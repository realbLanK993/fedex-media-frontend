## III. Calculated/Derived Metrics

These columns are automatically calculated based on the manual inputs.

38. **Total # of Pillars Present**

    - **Description:** The sum of all the binary communication pillar flags (typically columns P and T through AK in the standard template). Counts how many key messages were present in the article.
    - **Calculation:** `SUM(of all relevant pillar columns that are marked '1')`

39. **President**

    - **Description:** A simple "Yes" or "No" flag indicating if the `AMEA/APAC President Positioning` pillar (Column Q) was marked as '1'.
    - **Calculation:** `IF(AMEA/APAC President Positioning = 1, "Yes", "No")`

40. **AMEA Executive**

    - **Description:** A "Yes" or "No" flag indicating if the `AMEA/APAC Executive Present` pillar (Column R) was marked as '1'.
    - **Calculation:** `IF(AMEA/APAC Executive Present = 1, "Yes", "No")`

41. **Local Leader**

    - **Description:** A "Yes" or "No" flag indicating if the `Local Leader Present` pillar (Column S) was marked as '1'.
    - **Calculation:** `IF(Local Leader Present = 1, "Yes", "No")`

42. **Publication Weight**

    - **Description:** A predefined numerical weight or score assigned to each media outlet based on its tier, influence, or importance. This value is looked up from a separate "Publication List" or master data.
    - **Type:** Lookup (Numeric, often a percentage or a factor).

43. **Page Weight**

    - **Description:** A numerical weight assigned based on the `Page Position` of the article. More prominent positions (e.g., front page, above the fold) receive higher weights.
    - **Type:** Lookup (Numeric, typically a percentage or a factor, e.g., 100% for best position).

44. **Section Weight**

    - **Description:** A numerical weight assigned based on the `Section Position` of the article. Placement in more relevant or prominent sections receives higher weights.
    - **Type:** Lookup (Numeric, typically a percentage or a factor).

45. **W Circ (Raw Circulation for Calculation - AS)**

    - **Description:** This column represents the **numerical value of Circulation (Column H)** to be used in subsequent calculations. If "Circulation" is "Not Found", this is treated as 0. The column header in the sheet "W Circ" might be misleading if it's just the raw number. _Alternatively, if this column intends to be `Circulation _ Publication Weight`, the calculation would be `Circulation (H) _ Publication Weight (AP)`._ The formulas in AU and AV suggest AS might be an intermediate weighted value. For clarity, let's assume it's the raw circulation value for now unless specified otherwise.
    - **Calculation (if raw):** `VALUE(Circulation (H), treat "Not Found" as 0)`
    - **Calculation (if intermediate weighted):** `Circulation (H) * Publication Weight (AP)`

46. **Ph mult (Photo/Video Multiplier)**

    - **Description:** A multiplier applied to the circulation if a photo or video featuring the company was included. Typically a value like 1.15 (for a 15% boost) if "Yes", and 1.0 if "No".
    - **Calculation:** `IF(Photo/Video (J) = "Yes", [defined_multiplier_e.g_1.15], 1.0)`

47. **Weighted Circulation (uncorrected)**

    - **Description:** An intermediate weighted circulation value.
    - **Calculation:** `W Circ (AS) * Ph mult (AT)`. (If AS is raw circulation, this is `Raw_Circulation * Photo_Multiplier`. If AS is `Circulation * Pub_Weight`, then this is `Circulation * Pub_Weight * Photo_Multiplier`).
    - _The exact formula depends on the definition of column AS._

48. **Weighted Circulation**

    - **Description:** The final key metric representing the overall weighted reach or impact of the article. It considers the outlet's base circulation/reach, modified by weights for publication tier, article placement, section, and presence of visuals.
    - **Calculation:** `Weighted Circulation (uncorrected) (AU) * Page Weight (AQ) * Section Weight (AR)`
    - If `Weighted Circulation (uncorrected)` (AU) is `Circulation * Pub_Weight * Photo_Multiplier`, then this is `Circulation * Pub_Weight * Photo_Multiplier * Page_Weight * Section_Weight`.

49. **Positive Weighted Circulation**

    - **Description:** The value of `Weighted Circulation` (AV) if the article's `Sentiment` (Column M) is "Positive". If sentiment is "Negative" or "Neutral", this value is 0. This is used to isolate the impact of positive coverage.
    - **Calculation:** `IF(Sentiment (M) = "Positive", Weighted Circulation (AV), 0)`

50. **Cumulative Executive**
    - **Description:** This metric captures the `Positive Weighted Circulation` if any executive (AMEA/APAC President, AMEA/APAC Executive, or Local Leader) was featured in the article. If no executive was present, this value is 0.
    - **Calculation:** `IF(OR(President (AM)="Yes", AMEA Executive (AN)="Yes", Local Leader (AO)="Yes"), Positive Weighted Circulation (AW), 0)`
