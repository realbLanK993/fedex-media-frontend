    text: 'Gurgaon: Cars manufactured at Maruti Suzuki\'s main factory in Manesar can directly board railway carriages within the compound as they head to sellers in different parts of the country. The country\'s largest multi-modal cargo terminal, which is located inside the factory premises, was inaugurated on Tuesday by railways minister Ahswani Vaishnaw and chief minister Nayab Singh Saini. The terminal is part of the first phase of Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor (HORC) project, which aims to streamline logistics in the state by connecting Palwal to Sonipat via Manesar and other industrial hubs. To be used exclusively by Maruti Suzuki, the terminal has a direct link with Northern Railway at Patli through a 6.9km track. From Patli, cargo rakes can go to Rewari and switch to the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC). The terminal can handle 4.5 lakh cars annually. The capacity, if utilised, will take both pollution and traffic pressure off NH-8 and other road links between north and west, two of the country\'s most industrialised belts. After flagging off the first train from the Manesar plant for Nagpur in Maharashtra with 276 cars, Vaishnaw said, "In Dec 2021, govt simplified the process to set up multi-modal cargo terminals, and today, there are 108 such terminals ready." Saini said vehicles manufactured at the Manesar plant could reach 380 cities and those meant for export can reach ports in Gujarat via DFC. "This will directly connect Haryana to the global supply chain," Saini said. Hisashi Takeuchi, managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, said he was "very happy" that the country\'s largest automobile in-plant railway siding was inaugurated in Manesar. "The company\'s second railway siding facility signifies a landmark achievement in its green logistics journey. The project underscores our strong commitment to India\'s net-zero emissions target. It will contribute to avoiding 175,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, saving 60 million litres of fuel annually at full capacity, and reducing road congestion," Takeuchi said. He added that the automaker aims to transport 35% of its vehicles through railways by 2030-31. Maruti has dispatched 25 lakh vehicles by rail since 2014-15. But it started out by transporting cars to a railway station in trucks before loading them onto trains. The company, a few months ago, inaugurated its first railway siding facility at its Gujarat plant. Last year, Maruti started using the \u2018truck on train\' facility from Rewari. For this too, cars were loaded into trucks, but the trucks were directly driven onto trains. Spread over 46 acres, the Manesar terminal has four tracks for rakes and one for engine escape, totaling 8.2km in length. Registered under PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, it was executed by Haryana Orbital Rail Corporation Ltd, a joint venture. Under this, Maruti is supposed to invest Rs 325 crore for the orbital corridor apart from Rs 127 crore for yard development in its Manesar plant.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

Describing the terminal as a transformative milestone, the CM emphasized its potential to drive prosperity among farmers, entrepreneurs, and traders while creating new employment opportunities for the youth. Highlighting the state's growing appeal for global investors, Saini lauded the Saraf Group from Dubai for investing in the region. \"This investment reflects strong confidence in Haryana's pro-business environment and represents the deepening economic ties between India and the UAE,\" CM Saini stated. The state-of-the-art terminal, spread across 18 acres, offers integrated facilities such as customs clearance, warehousing, and cold storage under one roof\u2014amenities once exclusive to metros like Delhi and Mumbai. The CM asserted that such infrastructure would significantly boost the ease of doing business and open up new avenues for investment in Haryana.

As the term suggests, a multi-modal terminal is a specially designed facility that helps transfer goods between different modes of transportation. The idea is to leverage the strength of different transportation modes \u2013 cost-efficacy and eco-friendliness of railways, flexibility and last-mile connectivity of road, and speed of air freight. According to govt officials, there are 108 such terminals in India.What about the Manesar terminal? The two-storey terminal, India's largest such facility, was built over 46 acres inside Maruti Suzuki India's manufacturing plant in Manesar. It will be used exclusively by the automaker.How will it operate and what are its benefits? Cars manufactured at Maruti's Gurgaon plant will be transported by truck to the Manesar plant, where they will be loaded into railway coaches for dispatch to various destinations. Vehicles manufactured at the Manesar plant will be directly loaded into railway coaches from the cargo terminal for transporting across India. This will reduce the carmaker's reliance on trailer trucks, eventually easing road and highway traffic, including in NCR. Officials told TOI the company engages 9,000 truck transporters for ferrying its vehicles across India.How is this different from \u2018truck on train' RoRo (roll on, roll off) service? The \u2018truck on train' service for auto parts, rolled out on the western freight corridor from Rewari last year, allowed companies to send trucks loaded with auto parts or vehicles to be loaded onto trains. Once the cargo rakes reach their destination, trucks roll down the train and deliver the goods.How will cars be transported across India from the terminal? According to officials, the terminal will facilitate transport to 380 Indian cities. From the Manesar plant, cargo trains will go up to Patli station, which is part of the 126km Haryana Railway Orbital Corridor (HORC) project. HORC, of which only the Manesar-Patli portion has been completed till now, will connect Palwal to Sonipat through a broad-gauge double railway line for both passenger and goods traffic. The corridor, meant to decongest train traffic in Delhi with a bypass, will enable faster and more-affordable long-distance travel from Gurgaon, Manesar and other industrial hubs of Haryana. Patli station also falls on the Northern Railway line, which goes to Rewari, where it can switch to the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC). This 1,500km freight corridor starts from Dadri in UP and transports goods up to Gujarat \u2014 where Mundra and Pipavav ports are located. The freight corridor, once completed, will eventually reach JNPT port in Mumbai.What is railways' share in transporting Maruti vehicles? The automaker started dispatching its vehicles through railways over a decade ago. About 5% of vehicles manufactured by Maruti were transported via rail in 2014-15. This share steadily went up over the year, reaching 24% last financial year. The company says it aims to transport 35% of its production through trains by 2030-31.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'Ghaziabad: The district administration has rolled out a safety and logistics plan for the upcoming kanwar yatra, implementing a multi-layered security apparatus and essential facilities for the annual pilgrimage that begins on July 10. District magistrate Deepak Meena, who chaired a preliminary review meeting on Tuesday, said the administration was committed to ensuring a smooth and safe passage for pilgrims while maintaining minimal disruption to local life. "Our primary focus is to facilitate an orderly and secure yatra. All preparations will be completed well in advance, with no compromise on pilgrim facilities or public safety," he said. The DM asked officials to either shut or relocate meat and liquor shops that are located along the kanwar route and near temples. He also instructed them to prohibit the use of plastic during the pilgrimage. "Non-vegetarian and alcohol-selling establishments will be kept away from the kanwar route to maintain the sanctity of the pilgrimage. We will be vigilant about this and take appropriate action if any violation occurs," Meena said. The administration\'s plan includes the deployment of 11 zonal magistrates, 24 sector magistrates, and NDRF teams along the route. The main kanwar path will span 25km from Muradnagar to Tila Mod, and 42.5km from Kadarabad border in Ghaziabad to Delhi border, with the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, NH-24, and NH-9 serving as alternative routes. Meena said they would deploy divers and boats at the Ganga canal to bolster safety. "To avoid any untoward incident, we will make sure divers and two boats are available at Ganga nahar (canal) for rescue operations if needed. Furthermore, seven divers will be deployed at the canal\'s bridge along with NDRF teams," he added. Additional district magistrate (administration) Ranvijay Singh said resting facilities would also be in place for the pilgrims. "A total of 165 kanwar camps will be set up across the district to provide resting spaces and facilities to kanwariyas. There will be separate toilet facilities for men and women, proper disposal of garbage, food, drinking water, medical aid, and a team of 14 inspectors to check the purity of food and drinks. " Additionally, there will be 30 ambulances, 20 medical camps, 50 watch towers, 180 beds, 360 vials of vaccines and anti-venom medicines, along with 150 tankers to supply drinking water. Police have been tasked with installing 180 CCTV cameras along the route. The public works department will repair potholes by this month. The DM also urged stricter monitoring of drunk and rash driving. "Drivers found under the influence of alcohol or drugs should face strict action. We will not compromise on road safety during the pilgrimage," he said. Power supply will remain uninterrupted as the administration has asked municipalities and panchayats to keep generator sets ready. The forest department will cut and trim trees along the route to avoid accidents and ensure clear visibility for devotees. Meena stressed the need for coordination among all departments concerned. "Every department must perform its duties efficiently in a coordinated manner. Our aim will be to make the kanwar yatra a smooth and trouble-free pilgrimage for all," the DM said.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

Smith, who transformed the logistics industry with the concept of overnight delivery, leaves behind a legacy that reshaped global commerce and created one of the world\u2019s most recognisable brands. \u201cIt is with profound sadness and a heavy heart that I share that Frederick W Smith, our founder and executive chairman, died earlier today,\u201d wrote FedEx President and CEO Raj Subramaniam in a message to employees. \u201cFred was more than just the pioneer of an industry\u2026 he was the heart and soul of FedEx \u2013 its PSP culture, values, integrity, and spirit.\u201d Smith's journey from a college student with an unconventional idea to the architect of a global shipping empire is legendary. As reported by the Commercial Appeal, the concept behind FedEx was born from a 1965 term paper he wrote at Yale University, proposing a system for time-sensitive deliveries\u2014a vision few believed in at the time. \u201cThe overwhelming body of opinion said it wouldn\u2019t work, or that we couldn\u2019t raise the money,\u201d Smith once recalled. FedEx officially began operations in 1973, and despite early financial and regulatory challenges, the company revolutionised air cargo delivery, offering businesses rapid shipment of urgent goods like electronics and machine parts. Before FedEx, such deliveries were largely dependent on passenger flights, lacking the efficiency Smith envisioned.\n\nPiyush Goyal Says India Will Be $32 Trillion Economy By 2047, Sends Message To UK And Opposition\n\nSmith led FedEx for decades, helping grow it into a multibillion-dollar enterprise employing hundreds of thousands worldwide. Along the way, he forged relationships with major political figures, including George W Bush and John McCain, advocating for open trade and deregulation, key to FedEx\u2019s business model. Born on August 11, 1944, in Marks, Mississippi, Smith faced adversity early in life. Raised in Memphis after his father's death, he overcame a childhood hip disorder to become an athlete in high school. He showed early promise as both a pilot and entrepreneur, co-founding a record label at age 15 and later mastering both aviation and economics at Yale. Jim Barksdale, former FedEx COO and later CEO of Netscape, once said, \u201cHe is the most impressive executive I have ever met.\u201d Smith\u2019s death marks the end of an era for FedEx and the logistics industry at large. As Subramaniam noted, \u201cIn the coming days and weeks, I know we will all find ways to honor his memory and pay tribute to his legacy.\u201d\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'Kurukshetra: Haryana is set to become a major force in India\'s logistics and supply chain sector, chief minister Nayab Singh Saini announced during the inauguration of the Inland Container Depot (ICD) and the PM Gati Shakti Cargo Terminal at Dhirpur in Kurukshetra. Describing the terminal as a transformative milestone, the CM emphasised its potential to drive prosperity among farmers, entrepreneurs, and traders while creating new employment opportunities for the youth. Highlighting the state\'s growing appeal for global investors, Saini lauded the Saraf Group from Dubai for investing in the region. "This investment reflects strong confidence in Haryana\'s pro-business environment and represents the deepening economic ties between India and the UAE," said Saini. The state-of-the-art terminal, spread across 18 acres, offers integrated facilities such as customs clearance, warehousing, and cold storage under one roof \u2014 amenities once exclusive to metros like Delhi and Mumbai. The CM said such infrastructure would significantly boost the ease of doing business and open up new avenues for investment in Haryana. The project is a key part of the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan, aimed at building holistic infrastructure. Saini stressed that the terminal was not just a logistics hub for Haryana but also a strategic gateway benefiting neighbouring states like Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. "This is a shining example of integrated infrastructure development and our commitment to making India a developed nation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s vision," he said. The Saraf Group is also operating a Multimodal Logistics Park on 115 acres in Palwal, while developing a transshipment hub on 30 acres in Rewari, further reinforcing the state\'s growing logistics network. Saini attributed the progress to the vision of former CM Manohar Lal, who endorsed the project during a visit to Dubai. "This ICD project is a seal of approval on our simple yet powerful economic and logistics policies," he said. The CM also highlighted the role of Haryana\'s department of foreign cooperation, which was supporting businesses and facilitating skilled manpower for global markets. The terminal is expected to reduce logistics costs by 20-30% and significantly cut down delivery time. This will increase the credibility and global demand for Haryana\'s products. "As transportation, packaging, and logistics services grow, it will also generate thousands of job opportunities for our youth," Saini remarked. Calling Dhirpur depot a "Gateway to Global Trade", the CM urged the young entrepreneurs to take full advantage of this facility and contribute to making Haryana India\'s top export hub. The inauguration ceremony was attended by several dignitaries, including former minister Subhash Sudha, Saraf Group vice-chairman Sharafuddin Saraf, ,chairman Salah Saraf, Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Neha Singh, SP Nitish Aggarwal, and other prominent persons and officials.

    text: "A truly developed India by 2047 will not be possible without world-class logistics. And world-class logistics starts are only possible with a smart, connected, future-ready infrastructure.\n\nSince 2014, Indian Railways have fast-tracked the delivery of critical projects. (AI image)\n\nBy MP Singh India is on a bold mission - to be a $30 trillion economy by 2047, the centenary of our independence. To achieve this ambitious dream, we require more than just aspiration; we need a coordinated approach, to enable an infrastructure spine which delivers swift, dependable and affordable movement of goods within the country. Currently, close to 60 percent of India\u2019s freight still moves by road. While roads are critical for connectivity - especially for the last mile - relying primarily on them for long-haul freight is not the most efficient and strategic solution. Rail, a far more efficient and safer alternative for bulk transport, carries just about a quarter of our total cargo. Inland waterways, despite their huge potential, are used even less. Today, India spends nearly 14 to 18 percent of its GDP on logistics-related costs. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed for making Indian manufacturing cost competitive. While railways are a better option when compared to roads for freight movement, freight trains largely travel at average speeds of 25 to 30 km/h, primarily because of congestion on tracks being shared with passenger trains and bottlenecks at critical yards. Ports, which should function as express gateways for export-import traffic, take 2-3 days to turn around, whereas the global standard for ports is 10-12 hours. However, the situation has now started taking a turn for the better. The Prime Minister's Gati Shakti National Master Plan is leading the charge for a logistics revolution. For the first time, India is thinking about infrastructure planning in an integrated, coordinated manner. Instead of constructing roads, railways, ports, and airports in isolation, Gati Shakti brings all parties together on a common platform. This will let us plan in a more deliberate and deft manner, help avoid overlaps and link our networks with greater efficiency. Moreover, since 2014, Indian Railways have fast-tracked the delivery of critical projects, especially on high density routes by increasing capital expenditure substantially. The emphasis has been on commissioning projects linking major ports, production centres and mining areas. Concerted efforts have been made to eliminate network bottlenecks by carrying out major yard remodelling efforts and construction of rail flyovers on yards. Commissioning of Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) on eastern and western corridors has started yielding rich dividends by accelerating cargo movement on the busiest routes of Indian railways and simultaneously improving the average speed of passenger trains on existing, busy rail routes. Beyond the rail tracks, the development of multi-modal logistics parks - hubs that bring together road, rail, and port connectivity in one place - has started taking shape. These centres will help assemble goods, reduce handling times, and cut down on inventory and warehousing costs. They are the logistical equivalent of Smart Cities - streamlined, tech-enabled, and designed for the future. Of course, technology is also playing a notable role in this shift. From GPS-enabled cargo tracking to digital customs clearance at ports, we\u2019re witnessing the proliferation of real-time data availability and automation. Artificial intelligence is helping to predict freight demand, while blockchain is streamlining documentation and making cross-border movement smoother and more secure. But this shift and renewal is not just about technology and infrastructure, it must be bolstered by policy and people. Improved training is required for logistics professionals, and we need uniform rules between states, and quicker implementation of digital processes along the value chain. The government has already taken big steps with the GST- enabled E-way bill system: now the imperative is to keep the momentum going. The countries which have strengthened their freight railway network, have integrated the different modes of transport, and have removed various procedural bottlenecks in logistics movements have reaped ample benefits - most significantly with reduced logistics costs. India can - and must - adapt these principles to capitalise on its own strengths. With our demographic advantage, growing digital maturity, and strong political will, we\u2019re in a better position than ever to make bold changes. Our objective should be to cut logistics costs down to 12 percent of our GDP by 2030. By 2040, it should be at par with global standards - 8 percent or below. This is about delivering far more than just reduced costs. It's also about enhancing the ease of doing business, generating new employment, and enabling agile, sustainable, and more secure exports and goods movement. This is a national imperative - one that demands coordination at every level of government and industry. Each track we lay and each corridor we finish should be in aid of this vision. Organisations that have these mandates, must not view themselves as builders of rail infrastructure \u2013 instead, they should view themselves as facilitators of growth, efficiency, and opportunity. A truly developed India by 2047 will not be possible without world-class logistics. And world-class logistics starts are only possible with a smart, connected, future-ready infrastructure. The tracks for tomorrow are being laid today. And they are on the right course.(MP Singh is Director (Operations) at Rail Vikas Nigam Limited)\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

This terminal, a part of the Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor, directly links the factory to the Northern Railway, enabling the transport of 4.5 lakh cars annually.\n\nMaruti Suzuki inaugurated India's largest multi-modal cargo terminal at its Manesar plant, streamlining car dispatches via railways. This terminal, part of the Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor, connects directly to Northern Railway, enhancing logistics and reducing pollution. With a capacity of 4.\n\nGURGAON: Cars manufactured at Maruti Suzuki's main factory in Manesar can directly board railway carriages within the compound as they head to sellers in different parts of the country. The country's largest multi-modal cargo terminal, which is located inside the factory premises, was inaugurated on Tuesday by railways minister Ahswani Vaishnaw and chief minister Nayab Singh Saini. The terminal is part of the first phase of Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor (HORC) project, which aims to streamline logistics in the state by connecting Palwal to Sonipat via Manesar and other industrial hubs. To be used exclusively by Maruti Suzuki, the terminal has a direct link with Northern Railway at Patli through a 6.9km track. From Patli, cargo rakes can go to Rewari and switch to the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC). The terminal can handle 4.5 lakh cars annually. The capacity, if utilised, will take both pollution and traffic pressure off NH-8 and other road links between north and west, two of the country's most industrialised belts. After flagging off the first train from the Manesar plant for Nagpur in Maharashtra with 276 cars, Vaishnaw said, \"In Dec 2021, govt simplified the process to set up multi-modal cargo terminals, and today, there are 108 such terminals ready.\" Saini said vehicles manufactured at the Manesar plant could reach 380 cities and those meant for export can reach ports in Gujarat via DFC. \"This will directly connect Haryana to the global supply chain,\" Saini said. Hisashi Takeuchi, managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, said he was \"very happy\" that the country's largest automobile in-plant railway siding was inaugurated in Manesar. \"The company's second railway siding facility signifies a landmark achievement in its green logistics journey. The project underscores our strong commitment to India's net-zero emissions target. It will contribute to avoiding 175,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, saving 60 million litres of fuel annually at full capacity, and reducing road congestion,\" Takeuchi said. He added that the automaker aims to transport 35% of its vehicles through railways by 2030-31. Maruti has dispatched 25 lakh vehicles by rail since 2014-15. But it started out by transporting cars to a railway station in trucks before loading them onto trains. The company, a few months ago, inaugurated its first railway siding facility at its Gujarat plant. Last year, Maruti started using the \u2018truck on train' facility from Rewari. For this too, cars were loaded into trucks, but the trucks were directly driven onto trains. Spread over 46 acres, the Manesar terminal has four tracks for rakes and one for engine escape, totaling 8.2km in length. Registered under PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, it was executed by Haryana Orbital Rail Corporation Ltd, a joint venture. Under this, Maruti is supposed to invest Rs 325 crore for the orbital corridor apart from Rs 127 crore for yard development in its Manesar plant.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: "Digital skills are proving to be a critical lever for MSME resilience. From basic digital literacy - such as navigating online platforms, to more advanced capabilities like eCommerce integration, payment systems, and digital marketing.\n\nMicro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have long been instrumental in steering India\u2019s economic progress. (AI image)\n\nBy Jason Fremstad Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have long been instrumental in steering India\u2019s economic progress. Often referred to as the backbone of the Indian economy, this sector generates employment for over 240 million people and contributes ~30% to the GDP. Today, MSMEs stand at a crucial inflection point, one defined by the ability to scale, embrace innovation, and build lasting resilience. Across urban and rural India alike, MSMEs are increasingly turning to digital tools to fuel their growth. From accessing new markets to managing inventory more efficiently, these businesses actively integrate technology to sharpen their competitive edge. However, the true catalyst for success is not simply the availability of digital tools, but the ability to use them effectively. This is where digital upskilling matters. When entrepreneurs and their teams are equipped with the right skills, they are able to fully harness the potential of digital platforms. This foundational layer of digital literacy enables MSMEs to convert capability into tangible outcomes, higher sales, or faster access to credit. The impact goes beyond short-term gains; it lays the groundwork for long-term sustainability. Digital skills are proving to be a critical lever for MSME resilience. From basic digital literacy - such as navigating online platforms, to more advanced capabilities like eCommerce integration, payment systems, and digital marketing. Upskilling allows businesses to streamline processes, improve customer engagement, and make data-driven decisions. According to a 2025 ICRIER report, over 60% of MSMEs with an online presence also invested in employee training. This clear correlation underscores how skilling directly supports successful digital adoption. For India\u2019s microenterprises, which make up a majority of the MSME landscape, the benefits of digital adoption are even more significant. These businesses often face legacy constraints such as limited access to capital, lack of infrastructure, and regional isolation. When paired with training, digital tools can help microenterprises overcome these traditional barriers and potentially evolve into more robust, small-sized enterprises. Digital skilling also equips MSMEs to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics. Whether it's a shift in consumer behavior, supply chain disruptions, or new regulatory requirements, digitally literate businesses are better prepared to respond. The agility afforded by digital fluency enables MSMEs to optimize their models in real time and capture new growth opportunities as they emerge. The second vital component of digital empowerment is access to platforms, tools, and the broader ecosystem. Digital platforms serve as powerful growth engines. Across sectors and regions, MSMEs are tapping into eCommerce, digital payments, logistics solutions, and enterprise apps to drive efficiency and expand reach. eCommerce platforms, in particular, have become transformative. They allow local businesses to connect with customers across the country, sometimes even globally, without the need for a physical retail presence. Consider the example of an entrepreneur in Maharashtra selling traditional Konkan food products. The seller is now reaching customers nationwide through digital platforms, sharing regional flavors far beyond her local market. Likewise, a textile artisan in Rajasthan uses eCommerce to bring handwoven home d\u00e9cor to homes across India. These stories reflect a broader shift\u2014MSMEs leveraging technology to grow smarter, serve their communities better, and adapt to a changing economy. More importantly, selling online helps MSMEs build something that\u2019s long been out of reach for many: a credible digital financial footprint. One of the key barriers micro businesses face in accessing affordable credit is the lack of formal financial records or collateral. However, by transacting digitally, MSMEs create verifiable records of sales and payments, which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness. This helps MSMEs access finance more easily and on better terms, allowing them to invest, create jobs, and enter new markets. This digital trail enhances trust and transparency, allowing financial institutions to make faster, more accurate lending decisions. As a result, MSMEs can secure timely financing on better terms, fueling expansion, innovation, and job creation. Research consistently shows that MSMEs that integrate digital tools report higher sales, improved profitability, and job growth, all of which contribute to stronger local economies. In this way, digital access is not just a business advantage, it\u2019s an economic multiplier. It connects MSMEs to a wider value chain, enabling access to capital, data, mentorship, and partnerships that would otherwise remain out of reach. Yet, digital adoption is not a standalone solution. For digital empowerment to truly deliver impact at scale, it must be supported by a robust, collaborative ecosystem. Skilling programs must be accompanied by accessible platforms, responsive financial services, and policy support. Industry players, large corporates, financial institutions, and government agencies all have a role to play in enabling this transformation. When these stakeholders work together, digital skilling and platform participation can become a competitive advantage, one that drives resilience, unlocks innovation, and powers sustainable growth across the MSME sector.(Jason Fremstad is SVP of Supplier Development, Sourcing, Walmart International)\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: "Ranchi: As quick commerce giants make deeper inroads into Ranchi's grocery segment, the city's age-old kirana stores are feeling the pressure. While several shops report up to 50% revenue loss, many are actively reworking their business models to survive the digital assault. \"We've seen a 25\u201330% drop in income in just one year. If we don't evolve, we're out of the game. We've added home delivery, accepted digital payments, and built strong local networks. That's how we're staying relevant,\" said Harsh Thakka of Raghuvanshi Stores, Main Road Manju Vijay of a general store at Karamtoli Chowk said her daily customer count has halved since quick commerce apps boomed. \"Young buyers just don't want to wait. Unless we offer door delivery and discounts, they don't even consider us.\" The Jharkhand Consumer Product Distributors' Association (JCPDA) estimates a 40% drop in Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) trade in Jharkhand in the past three years due to deep-discounting by e-commerce giants. \"Retailers can't match the predatory pricing and high margins offered to online platforms. Many traditional stores have shut down. It's a quiet crisis,\" said Sanjay Akhouri, JCPDA president. He warned of growing inequality in access to market support. \"Online companies get funding and subsidies, while kiranas are left to sink. If parity isn't brought in, we'll lose our local retail fabric,\" he said. Even consumers are beginning to notice quality concerns. \"Online platforms lure with low prices, but often deliver cheap or defective goods. We build our business on trust that still counts for something,\" said Vishnu Sharma of Rajasthan Shoppe. Ranchi's retail backbone is under threat. Small shopkeepers are being squeezed out due to unfair practices by big e-commerce platforms. We demand a level playing field, same margins, same schemes, or traditional retail will collapse,\" said Paresh Gattani, president of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI). But in this speed race, it's not just the shops feeling the heat, delivery workers are too under stress. \"I work nearly 14 hours a day, from 8 am to 10 pm, with barely time for lunch. On weekends, it gets worse, constant orders, rain or heat, no breaks. My phone is always buzzing. We get penalties if we're late, but traffic, rain, or bad addresses, no one cares.

    text: "India\u2019s online market is booming every year. From phones to fashion, people are now shopping more through apps and websites. But for many small sellers, switching from shop counters to digital screens is still difficult. This gap in the system has created opportunities for new companies to help. One such name is DPKSTECH PRIVATE LIMITED, a smart company based in Faridabad. They have developed a special model that connects manufacturers, resellers, and customers in one smooth chain. The company runs two main brands: Covero and FashionCart. Covero sells affordable mobile accessories like glass cases starting from \u20b999 and stylish anime cases from \u20b969. FashionCart brings trendy jewellery like rings, pendants, and bracelets starting from \u20b9150. The goal is simple \u2014 to give people useful and beautiful products at low prices, all while helping small resellers grow. Over 8,000 resellers now use DPKSTECH\u2019s platforms \u2014 more than 5,000 for Covero and 3,000 for FashionCart. Many of them were earlier using WhatsApp or running local shops. But now, they place orders online, track their shipments, and even manage their customers better. This shift from offline to online has transformed their businesses completely, giving them new hopes and better incomes. Faridabad, a busy city in Haryana, is home to the company\u2019s main office. From here, they control logistics and customer support for resellers across the country. Two years ago, when they started the company, the dream was simple \u2014 to give digital power to every small business owner. Today, that dream is helping sellers in big cities and small towns alike. Running such a fast-moving company is not easy. The company faced many issues \u2014 like teaching resellers how to use online tools, keeping prices low, and building a strong delivery system. But they never gave up. With constant training, feedback, and good planning, they made their platforms user-friendly and smooth. Their idea of \u201cgrowing together\u201d helped every partner feel like part of a family. One major success for DPKSTECH was moving thousands of resellers to their online platforms. With Covero\u2019s mobile cases starting from \u20b969 and FashionCart\u2019s jewellery from \u20b9150, people began trusting the brand for both price and quality. Their system now handles orders, payments, and shipping \u2014 making things simple for sellers and smooth for buyers. This shows how Indian companies can build great things with the right ideas. India is now seeing a mix of offline and online shopping, especially after the pandemic. People want faster service, better prices, and special products. The company\u2019s model fits right into this trend. By focusing on categories like mobile accessories and jewellery, they give more choices to customers without trying to be everything. It\u2019s this focused style that makes them stand out from other big sellers. Beyond just business, the company is creating real change. They are helping small shop owners learn digital skills, get better profits, and connect with more people. Their work creates jobs in tech, delivery, and customer service \u2014 mainly from their Faridabad hub. The company also plans to reach remote areas, sharing business opportunities with those who have limited access. This way, they\u2019re not just selling products \u2014 they\u2019re building futures.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

Customers can now get rapid delivery on items from Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, and more. Other fashion platforms like Ajio and Nykaa are also exploring ultra-fast delivery.\n\nMyntra has rolled out its \"M-Now\" 30-minute delivery service to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, following a successful pilot in Bengaluru, a report has said. Unlike Blinkit, Zepto and other food-related quick commerce platforms, M-Now will specifically focus on delivering clothes, including from premium brands, in 30-minutes. Notably, Blinkit and Zepto also deliver some basic apparels such as tees and shorts. The M-Now service, first trialed in Bengaluru last December with around 10,000 SKUs, now offers collections from nearly 600 brands. Customers in the expanded zones can now get rapid delivery on items from popular names like Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi\u2019s and even luxury beauty and accessory brands such as Dyson, YSL, Prada, Carolina Herrera, and Huda Beauty, as per a report by The Economic Times. Myntra CEO Nandita Sinha had previously indicated the company's plans to bring the service to Mumbai, New Delhi and Pune. She noted a \"significant demand from fashion-first and trend-focused premium customers for quick deliveries.\"\n\nOther fashion brands exploring quick-delivery\n\nMyntra's move is part of a larger trend in India's e-commerce landscape, where fashion platforms like Ajio and Nykaa, along with new-age brands such as Newme, Slikk and Blip, are all exploring ultra-fast delivery. This momentum was initially sparked by quick commerce pioneers like Blinkit, Instamart, and Zepto, who expanded beyond groceries to include fashion and apparel from brands like Jockey, Manyavar, Puma, and Adidas. The report also pointed out the challenges, saying that one key hurdle is customer behaviour. As per as Snitch founder Siddharth Dungarwal, while initial interest in fast delivery is high, shoppers often revert to purchasing only basic wardrobe essentials like black t-shirts or shirts through these services.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nLatest Mobiles\n\nView All\n\nLava Storm Lite 5G\n\n\u20b97,999\n\nView Specs\n\nItel Zeno 5G\n\n\u20b910,799\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix GT 30 Pro 5G\n\n\u20b924,999\n\nView Specs\n\nTecno Pova Curve 5G\n\n\u20b915,999\n\nView Specs\n\nAlcatel V3 Classic 5G\n\n\u20b912,999\n\nView Specs\n\nSamsung Galaxy M06 5G\n\n\u20b97,999\n\nView Specs\n\nAcer Super ZX 5G\n\n\u20b99,999\n\nView Specs\n\nOnePlus 13s 5G\n\n\u20b954,999\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix Note 50s 5G+\n\n\u20b915,999\n\nView Specs\n\nOPPO K13 5G\n\n\u20b917,150\n\nView Specs\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

The company said it is taking corrective action to rectify the lapses. \u201cExpired items were also kept along with others at the facility. They have since destroyed those products,\u201d said Anupama Patil, assistant commissioner (Food). The licence suspension will remain in effect until Zepto demonstrates compliance with food safety regulations. \u201cTill the contraventions are cleared, the facility will remain shut,\u201d joint commissioner(Food) Mangesh Mane said, adding that more inspections will be carried out at other Zepto warehouses besides other quick-commerce platforms. A spokesperson for Zepto said, \u201c...We have initiated an internal review and are working closely with the authorities concerned to ensure full and swift compliance.\u201d The company said it is taking corrective action to rectify the lapses and resume operations in accordance with the law.

    text: "India's quick commerce market is poised for substantial growth, potentially tripling by 2027. However, this rapid expansion is revealing underlying issues related to pricing strategies, workforce stability, and achieving profitability. While quick commerce is creating jobs, it heavily relies on gig workers, and faces challenges from cost structures and consumer expectations of deep discounts.\n\nRepresentative image\n\nBENGALURU: India\u2019s quick commerce market is set to triple in size by 2027, reaching Rs 1.5-1.7 lakh crore, but the segment\u2019s breakneck growth is exposing structural cracks in pricing, workforce stability, and profitability, according to a new report by consulting firm Kearney. The report, published Thursday, found that while quick commerce has expanded beyond impulse buys to staples like rice, atta, and edible oil, most of the demand is not new. About 92-93% of sales come at the expense of modern trade, e-commerce, and kirana outlets. Only 6-8% is truly incremental. Meanwhile, platform discounts average 6-9%, lower than ecommerce and modern trade players, which offer 13-18% off. Once delivery and handling fees are factored in, quick commerce becomes price-competitive only when compared to kiranas. Despite its popularity in top metros and tier-2 cities, adoption remains uneven across product categories. While snacks, cold beverages, and gifting items have seen strong traction, categories like fruits, vegetables, electronics, and personal care continue to see low migration, with consumers preferring in-store purchases or wider selections available on other channels. Quick commerce\u2019s most significant impact is in employment generation, but with trade-offs. It creates about 62-64 jobs per Rs 1 crore of monthly gross merchandise value, on par with general trade and higher than ecommerce (25-29) or modern trade (41-42). However, over 70% of these roles are last-mile delivery jobs, typically filled by gig workers with limited job security or benefits. Kearney expects a 60% surge in gig hiring in 2025 as platforms expand. Brands are increasing their spend on the channel, with investment levels in food categories now on par with ecommerce. But non-food segments remain split, with quick commerce trailing traditional channels in personal care and household products. The report further suggested that while the model is scaling fast, it faces long-term pressure from its cost structure, reliance on gig labour, and the limited pricing power it holds over consumers already conditioned to deep discounts on other platforms.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'Pune: A few days after Maharashtra FDA suspended quick commerce player Blinkit\'s food licence in the Balewadi area due to regulatory non-compliance, the authority instructed food safety officers (FSOs) in the city to aggressively crack down on dark stores that are flouting food safety compliance norms. A dark store is a retail location that functions solely as a fulfilment centre for online orders. Thestate Foodand Drug Administration(FDA) will conduct random inspections of all the quick-commerce dark stores across the city to check for licences and hygiene at these units. "We are gathering a list of all dark stores in the city. Our FSOs will conduct random inspections at these unitsto thoroughly check documentationand hygiene practices. We will take stringent measures such as suspension or cancellation of licences if any stores are found to be non-compliant," said Suresh Annapure, joint commissioner (Food) of FDA, Pune region. During inspections, food safety officerswill take into account Schedule 4 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which outlines general hygienic and sanitary practices for food business operators (FBOs). The schedule sets standards for general hygiene, registration, licencing, food handling practices, and condition of the premises. During an inspection on June 5, the state FDA found that Energy Darkstore Services, which operates as a Blinkit franchise, was running without a valid licence, and the facility had multiple compliance issues. The authority then ordered the immediate closure of the dark store. This follows a recent inspection conducted by the Maharashtra FDA at Zepto\'s dark house in Dharavi, Mumbai, revealed serious non-compliance issues such as fungal growth on certain food articles, storage of products near stagnant water, wet/filthy floors, and cold storage issues. "Most of the dark stores operated by quick commerce players are under a franchise model. If these stores are found in violation, they will have to stop business. However, the quick commerce player can continue business in other areas where dark stores are complying with regulations," clarified a senior FDA official. Blinkit did not comment on the developments. A Zepto spokesperson said, "Zepto complies with all FSSAI norms and maintains strict quality controls across our dark stores. We fully support efforts that promote food safety and are working closely with authorities to address any concerns and further strengthen our processes." These incidents have left quick-commerce customers feeling uneasy. "I order at least twice a day fromthese platforms. It is shocking to see pictures of dirty storage facilities and unhygienic storage racks. I might go back to ordering from my vegetable vendor down the road," said Gayatri Doshi, a resident of Pashan. Neeraj Kamdar, a resident of Hadapsar, said, "I am shocked to hear about the condition of the storage facilities. I am glad that authorities are taking up the issue. Customers are unaware ofwhat ishappening at the backend. There need to be stricter norms governing quick-commerce."\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

Despite this surge and a 16.8% recovery above pre-pandemic levels, the industry is expected to face net losses of Rs 20,000\u201330,000 crore due to high operating costs, including aviation fuel prices and lease obligations.\n\nRepresentative image\n\nIndia\u2019s aviation sector is projected to continue growing in FY2026, with domestic air passenger traffic expected to rise by 7\u201310% year-on-year, reaching between 175 and 181 million passengers, according to a report by ICRA. This projection follows a 7.6% increase in FY2025, when domestic traffic touched 165.4 million, marking a strong recovery at 16.8% above pre-pandemic levels recorded in FY2020. However, despite the steady growth in passenger numbers, the industry is likely to remain in the red. ICRA estimates a net loss of Rs 20,000\u201330,000 crore in FY2026, in line with the losses expected for FY2025. This is a sharp contrast to the Rs 1,600 crore net profit posted in FY2024, said ANI citing the report. According to the report, continued financial strain is being driven by elevated operating costs, including high aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices and increasing lease obligations tied to new aircraft acquisitions. While the interest coverage ratio\u2014a measure of a company\u2019s ability to meet interest payments\u2014is forecast to improve to between 1.5 and 2.0 times, it still reflects a cautious outlook. On the international front, Indian airlines are also projected to see strong growth. International passenger traffic is expected to increase by 15\u201320% in FY2026. In FY2025, Indian carriers flew 33.86 million international passengers, a 14.1% rise over the previous year and nearly 49% higher than the FY2020 figure. Recent monthly data supports this growth trend. Domestic air travel in May 2025 was estimated at 14.36 million passengers, representing a 4.1% increase over May 2024. However, traffic remained largely stable compared to April 2025. Airlines also expanded capacity by 5.1% year-on-year during the month. Despite positive trends in traffic and capacity, ICRA cautioned that profitability will remain under pressure. Persistent high fixed costs, elevated fuel prices, and increased interest expenses from aircraft leasing are expected to weigh heavily on financial performance. Additionally, carriers may face pressure on yields as they work to sustain high passenger load factors amid rising operating costs.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

The \u2018Made in India\u2019 Falcon 2000 will stand as a proud symbol of the nation\u2019s technological prowess and manufacturing excellence\u201d Dassault Aviation will also transfer the assembly of the front section of Falcon 8X and Falcon 6X, in addition to the wings and complete fuselage assembly of Falcon 2000 to DRAL. The transfer of assembly operations combined with major facility upgrades, will pave the way for the first flight of Falcon 2000 \u201cmade in India\u201d from Indian soil by 2028. Dassault Aviation chairman & CEO Eric Trappier said: \u201cThis new agreement, which will make Dassault Reliance Aerospace (DRAL) the first centre of excellence for Falcon assembly outside France and which will eventually enable the establishment of a final assembly line for the Falcon 2000, illustrates, once again, our firm intent to meet our \u2018make in India\u2019 commitments, and to contribute to the recognition of India as a major partner in the global aerospace supply chain. It marks the ramp-up of DRAL, in line with the strategic vision shared with our partner Reliance, which led to its creation in 2017 and is a testament to our unwavering belief in our future in India and serving India.\u201d The two companies say this be \u201ca significant step in advancing India\u2019s aerospace manufacturing capabilities\u201d and see \u201cIndia emerge as a strategic centre for high-end business jet manufacturing.\u201d DRAL will also become the \u201cCentre of Excellence\u201d (CoE) for Falcon series, including Falcon 6X and Falcon 8X assembly programs for Dassault Aviation, the first such CoE outside France. The state-of-the-art, final assembly line for Falcon 2000 jets will be established in Nagpur, Maharashtra. The JV between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Aerostructure or (DRAL) was established in 2017. The operations commenced with the setting up of a manufacturing facility at Mihan, Nagpur, later that year. Since delivering its first Falcon 2000 front section in 2019, DRAL has assembled over 100 major sub-sections for the Falcon 2000. \u201cDRAL is expected to recruit several hundred engineers and technicians over the next decade to support its expanding operations. This growth underscores Dassault Aviation\u2019s deep commitment to strengthening India\u2019s aerospace manufacturing ecosystem and advancing the nation\u2019s emergence as a global centre of excellence for high-precision aviation production,\u201d a joint statement of the two companies said.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad\n\nNEW DELHI: Jolted by the tragic crashes of Air India flight 171 and multiple helicopters in Uttrakhand within the last one month, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered a \u201ccomprehensive special audit\u201d of Indian aviation ecosystem. This covers scheduled, non-scheduled, and private airlines; maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) organisations; approved training organisations (ATOs); flying schools; air navigation service provider; airport operators, and ground handling agencies (GHAs). The audit will focus on \u201cexamining the safety management systems (SMS), operational practices, and regulatory adherence across all aviation domains.\u201d It will also audit \u201csupporting elements such as technology providers, emergency response systems, supply chain networks, and regulatory coordination bodies.\u201d Air safety expert Amit Singh said: \u201cDGCA has been auditing aviation since time immemorial. Wouldn\u2019t it be prudent to invite a third party to audit and why (have past) DGCA audits failed to reign in safety?\u201d\n\nAir India Crash: Experts Raise Alarming Questions After Aviation Tragedy In Ahmedabad Caught On Cam\n\nSame was the reaction of several others in the industry who have seen multiple audits, enhanced surveillances in the past. Also, for several years, the frail financial health of many aviation ecosystem players \u2014 specially airlines \u2014 has been a key vulnerability and the resolution for this is beyond the DGCA\u2019s scope. \u201cVery often in the last 2-3 decades such weak players (many of who have now shut shop) have warned authorities they will shut down if forced to dot all Is and cross all Ts which will affect connectivity,\u201d said industry insiders. "Hopefully the recent crashes will change things." The audit order issued by DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai says: \u201cTraditionally, regulatory and safety oversight functions within Indian aviation have been conducted in silos, with different directorates performing inspections and audits specific to their respective domains. These activities include planned/unplanned surveillance inspections, random spot checks and ramp inspections, which primarily assess compliance and safety within individual aviation segments. \u201d \u201cIn a significant paradigm shift, the comprehensive special audit is designed to transcend existing siloed assessments by evaluating the aviation ecosystem holistically\u2026. The goal is to generate a 360-degree evaluation of the aviation ecosystem, reflecting both its strengths and areas needing improvement. These special audits will be over and above the regulatory audits carried out as per the annual surveillance programme,\u201d Kidwai\u2019s order says. The special audits will be conducted by multidisciplinary teams led by a senior DGCA official (DDG/director) as the lead auditor, supported by specialists from flight standards, air safety, airworthiness, airspace & air navigation services, licensing, and aerodrome standards directorates. \u201cWhenever necessary, external experts from industry may be included to provide specialised insights. This diverse team composition ensures a comprehensive evaluation that leverages both regulatory expertise and industry-specific knowledge, fostering credible and actionable findings,\u201d the order says. Once the audit is over, the findings will be shared with the audited entities. They, in turn, will need to submit a corrective action plan (CAP) within 15 days. \u201cDGCA will monitor CAP implementation through progress reviews and verification audits, ensuring effective resolution of findings\u2026. Non-compliance with audit findings or failure to implement CAPs may result in progressive enforcement actions, including advisory guidance, formal warnings, operational restrictions, financial penalty, suspension, or revocation of licenses\u2026 Enforcement decisions will consider public safety, compliance history, and entity cooperation, ensuring fairness and proportionality/natural justice,\u201d the order says.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: "Following the recent Air India incident, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has initiated a comprehensive safety review, focusing on airline performance and passenger support. Minister Kinjarapu directed airports to improve passenger services during disruptions and enhance safety measures. Air India is restructuring flights due to Middle East conflicts and European restrictions, offering rebookings or refunds.\n\nThe ministry of civil aviation launched a comprehensive review of aviation safety, airline performance, and passenger support systems across the country on Thursday, in the wake of the recent Air India incident near Ahmedabad. Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu chaired a detailed video conference with airport directors nationwide to assess how airports are handling disruptions caused by weather changes, post-accident inspections, and airspace closures linked to geopolitical tensions.Here are the key directives issued to improve ground operations:\n\nAirports have been told to work closely with airlines to ensure that passenger\u2019s issues are resolved promptly and at the ground level.\n\nAvailability of food, water, and seating facilities at terminals must be ensured, specifically during delays or congestions.\n\nAdequate staff should be stationed at key touchpoints to proactively handle passenger grievances.\n\nAirport directors were asked to provide full support to airlines experiencing operational disruptions, including help with gate changes and other logistical arrangements.\n\nTo ensure a safe and secure airport environment, Airport Directors were instructed to strengthen wildlife hazard management, including measures to deter birds and stray animals.\n\nThe minister also held a high-level meeting with Air India\u2019s chairman and managing director to address three major concerns: maintaining operational continuity, improving transparency in public communication, and prioritising passenger safety. Due to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and night flying restrictions in Europe, Air India is experiencing reduced aircraft availability. The airline has decided to scale down some operations temporarily and restructure flight schedules. Passengers affected by cancellations or changes will be rebooked or offered full refunds. Air India has been urged to strengthen its ground coordination and improve the clarity and empathy of its communication with passengers. Similar meetings were held with senior management from SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Akasa on June 18 and 19, where the minister reviewed fleet readiness, safety protocols, passenger experience, and communication strategies with all carriers. He further announced that such operational reviews would now become a regular practice. Meanwhile, the aircraft accident investigation bureau (AAIB) began a formal probe into the Air India flight crash near Ahmedabad. A multi-disciplinary team began investigations on June 12, and recovered both black box sets, the Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, from the site. International teams from the NTSB and aircraft manufacturers have also joined the probe as per ICAO guidelines. The ministry confirmed that recovery work and evidence collection have been completed, and further analysis is underway. It reiterated its commitment to transparency, saying that the AAIB will follow all safety and investigative protocols. Addressing speculation around the black box being sent abroad for decoding, the ministry clarified that any decision on the location for analysis would be taken only after evaluating technical and security concerns. The ministry also urged all stakeholders to avoid speculation on such sensitive issues and to allow the investigation to continue with the seriousness and professionalism it deserves.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'Two weeks ago, Tamil Nadu govt officials announced that the state was going to soon release a policy on warehousing with a focus on the delta districts. Given that the state integrated logistics policy and action plan (ILPAP) was prepared in 2023, why a warehousing policy? A dedicated warehousing policy, expected to be launched by Oct 2025, could serve as a benchmark for integrating storage solutions in the entire logistics value chain, says state industry secretary V Arun Roy. The ILPAP is focused on "overall logistics movements in the state", he adds. A few national and international developments have made a warehousing policy imperative. First, the Union govt announced development standards for warehouses, which provides guidance on specific cargo type and services. "The (TN) policy would focus on warehousing as a sub-sector of the entire logistics ecosystem," says Roy. Second, the new US tariffs have opened up investment and expansion opportunities for TN and an efficient warehousing roadmap is critical to making the most of them. Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (Tidco) MD Sandeep Nanduri says, the state govt plans a "robust institutional mechanism" to support growth of the warehousing sector. At the heart of this plan is a more commodity-based approach instead of a one-size-fits-all policy. "This will ensure a broader coverage, from perishables to automobile, from cement to electronics, considering the diverse commodity profile of the state," he adds. Currently the state govt is consulting multiple stakeholders. "The policy aims to establish warehousing clusters in tier-2 and tier-3 cities that could seamlessly integrate with TN\'s industrial development plan," says Roy. Tamil Nadu is looking to develop several "logistics parks or MMLPs (multi-modal logistics parks), dry ports and other road and rail-based freight terminals, working with central logistics agencies and private players through PPP", he adds. Two major investments on this front are MMLP Mappedu (Chennai) and MMLP Coimbatore. "Mappedu is expected to be completed by 2027 following which the second phase would be constructed," says Roy. "We are in advanced stages of land acquisition near Coimbatore." The state\'s warehousing capacity is between 10-15 million sqft with large third-party logistics clusters in Chennai and Coimbatore. Chennai alone contributes more than 5 million sqft of warehousing volume, and Coimbatore contributes another 2 million sqft. The fragmented warehousing market in tier-2 and tier-3 cities is yet unaccounted for. With the new policy, govt would streamline the registration process, which would allow it to monitor the available space and gaps. "The focus of the warehousing policy is to capture the untapped potential of cities such as Hosur, Trichy, Madurai, Tuticorin etc," says Arun Roy. The policy focuses on the delta region because it is the hub for perishables, agro and fishing industries. "The region has a huge potential for development of cold storage facilities for domestic as well as export-oriented supply chain," says Arun Roy. Logistics experts say that apart from attracting new investments, the policy will also cater to existing investors. "Given TN\'s strong agricultural and horticultural base, developing infrastructure with temperature control and storage segregation that are integrated with downstream industries will greatly reduce wastage and improve value realisation for our farmers," says R Dinesh, chairman, TVS Supply Chain Solutions. Also, he adds, warehouses near manufacturing clusters should "align with production clusters and their supply chain needs". What will help is the development of a key transshipment hub in neighbouring Kerala. "India\'s first deepwater transshipment port at Vizhinjam is being built by Adani. Once fully operational, containers that are headed to Colombo for transshipment can be routed to Vizhinjam. This opens up a big warehousing opportunity for both north and south TN particularly Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari," says Rejyson Samuel, director & CEO, Sandook Logistics.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: "Learning Resources Inc. is escalating its fight against Trump's tariffs to the Supreme Court, arguing the former president overstepped his authority. The company emphasizes the urgent need for a ruling due to the tariffs' widespread impact on businesses and consumers, particularly with the approaching peak sales seasons.\n\nThis is a representative AI image\n\nAn Illinois-based toy maker, Learning Resources Inc., has taken its tariff battle to the US Supreme Court, urging the justices to swiftly rule on the legality of former President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs. In legal documents, the company emphasised the urgency, citing \"the tariffs' massive impact on virtually every business and consumer across the Nation, and the unremitting whiplash caused by the unfettered tariffing power the President claims.\" The company contends that Trump overstepped his authority by using an emergency powers law to impose tariffs without congressional approval. It filed the appeal in a bid to bypass ongoing proceedings in lower courts. Despite securing an initial lower court victory, the ruling remains suspended whilst an appeals court evaluates a similar decision that more broadly challenges Trump's tariffs. Currently, Trump maintains authority to collect tariffs under emergency powers legislation, with arguments scheduled for late July. The Supreme Court traditionally avoids cases before appeals courts reach decisions, reducing the likelihood of granting the expedited hearing requested by the company. Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg highlighted the current impact of tariffs and uncertainty, particularly concerning the approaching back-to-school and holiday periods, which typically generate their highest annual sales. \"All the people that are raising their prices are doing it with a sense of dread,\" Woldenberg told The Associated Press. But, \"we do not have a choice. We absolutely do not have a choice,\" he added. The company's legal representatives proposed scheduling arguments for late summer or early autumn. The Trump administration's defence maintains that emergency powers legislation authorises presidential control over imports during national emergencies, considering the persistent trade deficit as such an emergency. Trump presents tariffs as mechanisms to encourage domestic manufacturing, generate Treasury revenue, and negotiate more advantageous international trade agreements. Woldenberg described investing substantial resources into diversifying his company's supply chain, whilst acknowledging the process as lengthy and unpredictable. \"I think that our case raises uniquely important questions that this administration won't accept unless the Supreme Court rules on them,\" he said. The family-owned enterprise, located in Vernon Hills, Illinois, produces items including the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register for $43.99 and Botley the Coding Robot for $57.99.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

Carney revealed several initiatives to aid Canadian steel and aluminium industries facing 50 percent US tariffs, including new procurement policies favouring local suppliers and measures against dumping. As the primary foreign supplier of steel and aluminium to the United States, Canada\'s leader had previously condemned the doubled US tariffs on Canadian metal imports as "unjustified" and "illegal." Simultaneously, both nations began extensive discussions to restructure their trade relationship. During the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Monday, G7 leaders urged US President Donald Trump to step back from his aggressive trade policies. Following discussions between Carney and Trump at the summit, Canadian officials suggested a trade agreement could be reached within 30 days. Negotiations continue between both parties. Speaking on Thursday, Carney stated that a successful outcome would involve stabilising US-Canada trade relations and ensuring Canadian businesses maintain market access whilst preserving autonomy in global trade dealings. According to US government statistics, Canada exported 5.95 million tonnes of steel and 3.15 million tonnes of aluminium to the United States in the previous year.(With input from agencies)(This is a top Google Trends topic)\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

The agreement was reached during a virtual meeting on Monday between Pakistan\u2019s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, where the two sides discussed deepening trade and investment ties and strengthening the broader economic relationship, PTI reported. \u201cBoth sides also agreed that further technical-level discussions would take place in the coming days, following a mutually agreed roadmap,\u201d Radio Pakistan reported on Tuesday. The renewed push comes amid concerns in Islamabad over the 29% tariff that the US may impose on Pakistani exports. In April, President Donald Trump announced the measure as part of a broader plan to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit with various partners. Currently, Pakistan enjoys a $3 billion trade surplus with the US. Speaking at an event in Islamabad on Tuesday, Aurangzeb confirmed that momentum in the bilateral dialogue was building. \u201cBoth countries are moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. He added that the government was committed to staying on course with structural reforms. \u201cWe have also carried out tariff reforms to move towards a competitive economy,\u201d the minister said, highlighting efforts in taxation, energy, and other sectors. Aurangzeb described his latest exchange with the US Commerce Secretary as \u201cconstructive and positive,\u201d and said both sides were aligned on enhancing strategic economic cooperation.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

This move aligns with Apple's strategy to diversify its supply chain amid geopolitical tensions and potential tariffs. While the immediate impact is limited, it signifies Apple's commitment to building a comprehensive manufacturing ecosystem in India.\n\nApple supplier Foxconn is preparing to produce iPhone metal casings in India for the first time, breaking Tata Electronics ' exclusive hold on this component manufacturing locally. The move comes as Apple deepens its Indian operations amid President Trump 's recent threat of 25% tariffs on iPhones not manufactured in the United States. According to The Economic Times, Foxconn is establishing a dedicated unit at ESR Industrial Park in Oragadam, Tamil Nadu, specifically for iPhone enclosure production. Until now, the company's Indian operations focused primarily on iPhone assembly at its Sriperumbudur facility, along with AirPods assembly in Hyderabad.\n\nStrategic diversification amid geopolitical tensions\n\nThe timing appears significant following Trump's Truth Social warning to Apple CEO Tim Cook , demanding iPhone production move to America or face substantial tariffs. \"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump posted. Despite the political pressure, Apple continues expanding its Indian manufacturing footprint. The enclosure production represents part of Apple's broader supply chain diversification strategy, reducing dependence on any single region or supplier.\n\nLimited immediate impact but long-term significance\n\nWhile iPhone casings constitute only 2-3% of the device's total bill of materials, industry analysts view this as strategically important. Neil Shah from Counterpoint Research noted in ET's report that even with enclosure production, Foxconn's total India-based value addition will likely remain below 10%. \"This aligns well with Apple's broader strategy to derisk and diversify its supply chain,\" Prabhu Ram from CyberMedia Research. told The Economic Times. \"As India emerges as a lynchpin in Apple's growth momentum, it is a natural progression for Foxconn to expand its capabilities.\" Construction on the new facility has already begun at the same industrial park housing Foxconn's upcoming display module assembly plant. The development signals Apple's commitment to building an end-to-end manufacturing ecosystem in India, regardless of Washington's demands for American production.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nLatest Mobiles\n\nView All\n\nLava Storm Lite 5G\n\n\u20b97,999\n\nView Specs\n\nItel Zeno 5G\n\n\u20b910,799\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix GT 30 Pro 5G\n\n\u20b924,999\n\nView Specs\n\nTecno Pova Curve 5G\n\n\u20b915,999\n\nView Specs\n\nAlcatel V3 Classic 5G\n\n\u20b912,999\n\nView Specs\n\nSamsung Galaxy M06 5G\n\n\u20b97,999\n\nView Specs\n\nAcer Super ZX 5G\n\n\u20b99,999\n\nView Specs\n\nOnePlus 13s 5G\n\n\u20b954,999\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix Note 50s 5G+\n\n\u20b915,999\n\nView Specs\n\nOPPO K13 5G\n\n\u20b917,150\n\nView Specs\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'The U.S. is pressuring Vietnam to decrease its reliance on Chinese tech components in exported goods, potentially imposing tariffs if changes aren\'t made. Vietnam, a key hub for tech manufacturing, faces the challenge of restructuring its supply chains while balancing relations with China, a major investor.\n\namerica china\n\nThe United States has reportedly another plan to cut China\'s hardware and components supply chain for Apple, Google, Samsung, Meta and other technology companies. According to a report in Reuters, America is urging Vietnam to reduce Chinese technology in devices assembled in the country and exported to America. Vietnam, a hub for tech giants like Apple and Samsung, relies heavily on Chinese components, with Meta and Google also producing goods like VR headsets and smartphones there. Vietnam has held meetings with local businesses to increase the use of Vietnamese parts, with firms expressing willingness but noting the need for time and technology, one source told Reuters.\n\nTrump Tariffs: 46% tariff threat and ...\n\nThe Trump administration has threatened 46% tariffs, which could disrupt Vietnam\u2019s export-driven economy. One source said that Vietnam was asked to "reduce its dependency on Chinese high-tech" to restructure supply chains and lessen US reliance on Chinese components. Another source highlighted the US goal of accelerating decoupling from Chinese tech while boosting Vietnam\u2019s industrial capacity, citing VR devices as an example. With a US-imposed tariff deadline of July 8 looming, the scope and timing of a potential deal reportedly remain uncertain. Sources emphasized that reducing Chinese high-tech content in exports is a US priority. Last year, China exported $44 billion in tech goods to Vietnam, 30% of its total exports there, while Vietnam shipped $33 billion in tech goods to the US, per Vietnam\u2019s customs data. The US also wants Vietnam to address Chinese goods mislabeled as "Made in Vietnam" to evade higher duties. Vietnam\u2019s trade ministry noted progress in recent Washington talks but said key issues remain unresolved.\n\nWhat is Vietnam\'s big worry\n\nVietnam\u2019s Communist Party chief, To Lam, may meet President Trump in late June, though no date is confirmed, sources told Reuters. Local companies have shown willingness to adapt but warned that rapid changes could "destroy business," one source said. Industry experts note that Vietnam\u2019s supply chain lags China\u2019s by 15\u201320 years but is progressing in sectors like electronics. Abrupt shifts could strain Vietnam\u2019s ties with China, a key investor and also lead to security concerns.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nLatest Mobiles\n\nView All\n\nItel Zeno 5G\n\n\u20b910,799\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix GT 30 Pro 5G\n\n\u20b924,999\n\nView Specs\n\nTecno Pova Curve 5G\n\n\u20b915,999\n\nView Specs\n\nAlcatel V3 Classic 5G\n\n\u20b912,999\n\nView Specs\n\nSamsung Galaxy M06 5G\n\n\u20b97,999\n\nView Specs\n\nAcer Super ZX 5G\n\n\u20b99,999\n\nView Specs\n\nOnePlus 13s 5G\n\n\u20b954,999\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix Note 50s 5G+\n\n\u20b915,999\n\nView Specs\n\nOPPO K13 5G\n\n\u20b918,999\n\nView Specs\n\nLava Bold 5G\n\n\u20b912,999\n\nView Specs\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

To the United States specifically, exports fell around 11 percent, with automotive exports down 24.7 percent on-year, finance ministry data showed.\n\nRepresentative AI image\n\nJapanese auto exports to the United States fell almost a quarter in May, data showed Wednesday, as worries over Donald Trump\'s tariffs grow with Tokyo and Washington yet to strike a deal. Roughly eight percent of jobs are tied to the auto industry in Japan, which is home to the world\'s top-selling carmaker Toyota as well as Honda, Nissan and other giants. The government is seeking relief from the 25 percent US vehicle tariffs and other trade levies, but no agreement has been reached despite several rounds of talks. Japan posted a trade deficit for the second straight month in May, with imports exceeding the value of exports by 637.6 billion yen ($4.4 billion). To the United States specifically, exports fell around 11 percent, with automotive exports down 24.7 percent on-year, finance ministry data showed. "Car exports to the United States in May declined both by volume and value, but the impact of lower prices is overwhelmingly large," NLI Research Institute\'s Taro Saito said, adding that export volume declined 3.9 percent. "It appears that automakers are making large-scale price cuts so as to absorb the cost of the tariffs," he added. Japan, a key US ally and its biggest investor, is subject to the same 10 percent baseline tariffs imposed on most nations plus steeper levies on cars, steel and aluminium. Trump also announced an additional 24 percent "reciprocal" tariff on Japan in early April but later paused it along with similar measures on other countries. In Canada after the G7 summit, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters that US tariffs were "hitting many Japanese companies\' profits". The situation "could have a grave impact on both Japan and the United States as well as the world economy, directly and indirectly", he warned. Ishiba held face-to-face talks with Trump on Monday but no breakthrough on the trade impasse was announced. "As there are still some points where both sides disagree, we have not reached an agreement on the package as a whole," he said. "I had frank discussions with President Trump, and we agreed to instruct the relevant cabinet members to advance further discussions." Japan\'s trade surplus with the United States shrank 4.7 percent on-year in May -- the first contraction in the past five months, even as imports from the country dropped 13.5 percent.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

The 2018 summit ended with Trump assailing his Canadian hosts on social media as he departed on Air Force One, saying he had instructed the US officials who remained in Quebec to oppose the G7 joint statement endorsed by the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and, of course, Canada. \"I have instructed our US Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\" Trump posted on the site then known as Twitter. This time, Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme. Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China's continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains. Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \"We have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, This is what you're going to have to pay.' But I think we'll have a few, few new trade deals.\" At stake might be the survival of the G7 itself at a time when the Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether the president will attend the November Group of 20 summit in South Africa. What Trump opposed at the 2018 summit in Quebec wasn't just tariffs, but a focus on having alliances with a shared set of standards seeking to shape policies. \"The big dispute in Quebec were the references to the rules-based international order and that's where that famous photo comes from,\" said Peter Boehm, Canada's counselor at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and a veteran of six G7 summits. \"I think it gave everyone the idea that G7s were maybe not business as usual.\" The German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments have each signalled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can reduce the likelihood of outbursts. \"Well, I have got a good relationship with President Trump, and that's important,\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday as he flew to Canada. There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military. \"The Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,\" said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump's team for the G7 in Trump's first term. The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers' meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems. The G7 even briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation. Trump will have at least three scheduled bilateral meetings during the summit with other world leaders while in Canada, staring on Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The US president is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to an administration official. The US president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos, all of which have disproportionately hit Japan. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire. The United Kingdom reached a trade framework with the U.S. that included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts. Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump's first term. The Trump administration has insisted that its broad tariffs will produce trade agreements that box out China, though it's unclear how antagonizing trade partners would make them want to strengthen their reliance on the U.S. Carney, the Canadian leader, has been outspoken in saying his country can no longer look to the U.S. as an enduring friend. That might leave Trump with the awkward task of wanting to keep his tariffs in place while also trying to convince other countries that they're better off siding with the U.S. than China. \"Trump will try to coordinate the group against China's economic coercion,\" Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis. \"But the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren't imposing tariffs on his allies.\"\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: 'India seeks guarantees from the US against future tariffs as they finalize a bilateral trade agreement. India wants tariff stability, especially for labor-intensive sectors like leather and textiles. The goal is to secure preferential trade advantages through mutual duty reductions before the July 9 deadline.\n\nFor India, a primary concern revolves around the process by which the US will reduce duties. (AI image)\n\nIndia-US trade deal: With the Narendra Modi government and Donald Trump administration working to seal the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement at the earliest, India wants assurance that no further tariffs will be imposed. On April 2, the US President Donald Trump declared a reciprocal 26% tariff on Indian goods imports as part of global trade measures. These tariffs were suspended for 90 days until July 9, whilst maintaining the 10% baseline tariff. Both nations are working towards finalising the BTA before the deadline expires.\n\nTrade Deal: India Seeks Guarantee From US\n\nIndia has sought guarantees from the US against future tariff impositions by the Trump administration following the completion of the bilateral trade agreement (BTA). The negotiations are nearing completion, with both nations optimistic about swift resolution. India has requested benefits for sectors requiring substantial workforce, particularly leather and textiles. "We have put everything on the table," a source told ET, emphasising India\'s desire for tariff stability post-agreement. Standard trade agreements incorporate provisions for renegotiation or compensation when partners increase tariffs, and India aims to include similar safeguards. "This would ensure the agreement is ringfenced from prospective changes," another source stated. Also Read | \u2018Dramatic decline\u2026watch out\u2026\u2019: China\u2019s exports to US dip sharply amid Trump trade war; why India needs to be on the guard Trade specialists unanimously support the inclusion of such a provision. "The BTA should be timebound and not in perpetuity," a trade policy specialist said. "India must insist on a clawback provision \u2014 that it will withdraw benefits if the US raises tariffs or goes back on any of its commitments." Government representatives indicated that the United States needs to devise a strategy for tariff reduction, as India has requested concessions for industries including textiles and leather. Whilst the Trump administration presently needs US Congress approval to reduce duties below most favoured nation (MFN) rates, it possesses the authority to eliminate reciprocal tariffs. "We want preferential and sustained trade advantages and have left it to the US to decide the route it takes to reduce its tariff barriers\u2014whether through the Trade Promotion Authority or by seeking Congressional approval," an official said.\n\nIndia\u2019s concerns on Trade Deal With US\n\nFor India, a primary concern revolves around the process by which the US will reduce duties, as the absence of US Fast Track Trade Authority could potentially delay the proposed trade agreement.\n\nThe US Fast Track Trade Authority serves as a specialised provision enabling the American President to negotiate trade agreements and submit them to Congress for a straightforward vote, without modifications or procedural holdups.\n\nA government official indicated that the responsibility lies with US authorities to determine how to address their domestic regulations.\n\nOfficials said that both countries were examining a distinct combination of products under the proposed agreement, with India seeking reduced-duty access for its labour-intensive goods whilst offering concessions on American automobiles and select agricultural products. Both nations aim to finalise a bilateral trade agreement by September-October.\n\nThe administration is also assessing the consequences of the 50% duties on steel and aluminium, alongside the 25% duties on automobiles. Although the automotive parts industry anticipates minimal immediate effects, prolonged tariffs could potentially influence the sector. The official mentioned that India intends to seek concessions if they are granted to other nations.\n\nIndia-US trade deal: Early deal on the cards?\n\nThe government, aiming to secure the first tranche of the bilateral trade agreement with the US before July 9, has said that it seeks "preferential and sustained advantage" through mutual duty reductions.

"We are working on the early tranche and as you are aware that there is a date (July 9), before that we would like to conclude this early tranche,\u201d Commerce secretary Sunil Barthwa said.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

The commission also directed the company to pay him Rs 2,000 inlitigation costs.Sudhir Kumar Sharma of Sector 104, who submitted a complaint with the commission on March 6, 2024, said the consignment of medicines, valued at Rs 5,065, was to be delivered to his son, Gautam Siddharth, in London. He booked FedEx Express service on March 30, 2022, to deliver the parcel, but claimed it did not reach Siddharth within the stipulated timeline of April 11, 2022."We were communicating with the India and UK offices of FedEx to ensure the packet reached the UK. But instead of delivering the packet, the courier company decided to return the consignment to me. They stated the consignee was not reachable. For the return shipment, FedEx charged me another Rs 3,420," Sharma stated in his complaint.Sharma said he was told to submit several documents and the fee for the return shipment to get the packet from the Delhi Customs office. "I kept writing to FedEx Express to refund Rs 6,740 that I had spent on the onward and return shipment, but the company never replied. In the meantime, the medicines\' expiry date lapses," he said.The commission earlier issued a notice to the courier company seeking its reply. With no response from FedEx, the consumer commission (Noida) president, Anil Kumar Pundir, heard the matter ex parte from June 2024.Satisfied with the documentary evidence submitted by the complainant, the commission directed FedEx Express to pay him Rs 11,535 towards the cost of the medicine and the fee charged for the onward and return shipment, along with 6% interest from the date of the complaint until final payment. The commission also directed the courier company to pay Rs 2,000 in litigation charges within 30 days of the order.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: 'The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China. Consumers may face higher prices and delivery delays. Businesses relying on these Chinese sourcing must adjust. Some US manufacturers could benefit from reduced competition. The move follows increased tariffs between the US and China. Concerns exist about the capacity to handle the increased customs workload.\n\nAI Image\n\nNEW YORK: Consumers can expect higher prices and delivery delays when the Trump administration ends a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China Friday.\n\nThe expiration of the so-called de minimis rule that has allowed as many as 4 million low-value parcels to come into the US every day - mostly from China - is also forcing businesses that have built their models on sourcing production in China to rethink their practices in order to keep their costs down.\n\nBut some might actually benefit from the termination of the duty exemption. For instance, companies that make their goods in the US may feel relief from the competition of cheap Chinese imports, and likely experience a brighter sales outlook.\n\nThe move, which applies to goods originating from mainland China and Hong Kong, comes on top of President Donald Trump\'s new tariffs totaling 145% on China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on the US, fueling a trade war between the world\'s two largest economies. Sellers are already seeing cautious consumers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption "a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses."\n\n"We put an end to it," he said.\n\nWhat\'s the de minimis provision? Introduced in 1938, the de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $109 today. The threshold rose to $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.\n\nChinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service. And the US market has been a major destination.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden proposed a rule last year that said foreign companies can\'t avoid tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth $800 or less. Trump tried in February to end the exception but his initial order was called off within days when it appeared the US was not prepared to process and collect tariffs on the deluge of parcels coming in.\n\nWhat\'s the impact on shoppers? Consumers will face higher prices and delivery delays now that parcels will go through a more complicated customs process to enter the US involving declaration and duty payment.\n\nBusinesses could factor tariffs into the final price, or they can list them separately in the same way as sales taxes. For instance, Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists " import charges " that have reportedly doubled many items\' prices. (The retailer also has a "local warehouse" option for some products, which are shipped from within the US and therefore avoids the import charge.)\n\nMeanwhile, Shein, now based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that reads, "Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You\'ll never have to pay extra at delivery."\n\nAmazon says it\'s not planning to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its site - despite a report that sparked speculation the e-commerce giant would soon show the new import charges, and the White House has made fiery comments denouncing the purported change.\n\nWhat about sellers and carriers? Parcel carriers will be burdened with collecting duties, and the paperwork to comply with the new rule could result not only in higher prices but also delays and even disruptions to delivery, said Ram Ben Tzion of the vetting platform Publican.\n\nMajor commercial carriers such as UPS and FedEx have said they are well-equipped and prepared to collect duties on international parcels in compliance with local laws, including the new US rule.\n\nCommercial carriers will be collecting 145% tariffs on declared values. The US Postal Service, a government agency that offers international mail service, can choose either to charge a 120% tariff on low-value packages or a flat fee of $100 per shipment, which is set to rise to $200 on June 1.\n\nThe US Customs and Border Protection says it "stands ready to fully implement the restrictions on de minimis shipments and collect all revenue owed for these shipments on May 2, 2025."\n\nHowever, experts have expressed concerns that the surge in the workload could be a serious challenge.\n\nIn January and February, more than 70% of the 216 million packages coming into the US were originating from China, according to CBP.\n\nWhat\'s the impact on businesses? Those that relied on the de minimis exemption are now having to adjust.\n\nJohn Curry, owner and chief executive officer of HAPARI International, an Arizona-based swimwear business, had switched from bulk shipping to de minimis shipping about six months ago to improve cash flow, speed up delivery, and eventually eliminate US-based warehousing. His company makes its products in China and sells them directly to US customers via its own online storefront.\n\nCurry said he planned to stay the course and pay the additional 145% duty - one parcel at a time - while waiting for the US and China to work out a more sustainable approach.\n\n"There has to be a solution because both countries cannot survive this way," Curry said.\n\nIzzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, helps businesses like HAPARI to ship goods from its China-based warehouse using the de minimis exemption. He says US businesses are likely to stay in China for now given the competitiveness of the manufacturing base and of the supply chain in China but can be expected to raise prices.\n\nAnd while businesses with good profit margins probably will continue to ship from China, those that run on razor-thin profit margins are likely to "go local", setting up more US-based warehouses to defray tariff costs, he said.\n\nWho benefits? Trade groups representing flag manufacturers and bike dealers said they expect to benefit from the end of the duty exemption.\n\nIn written comments on the US Trade Representative portal, for instance, the Flag Manufacturers Association of America said its members have been bombarded by an onslaught of American flag imports mostly made in China that are falsely marketed and significantly discounted. The group cited a drop of 25% to 35% in industrywide sales of American-made US flags last year.\n\nLarry Severini, CEO of Embroidery Solutions Manufacturing LLC, which makes the star fields for US flag manufacturers, had to shutter one of his two plants in South Carolina earlier this year because of stiff competition from cheap imports. He noted sales have fallen 20% since 2021 in part because of the de minimis exemption.\n\n"We need duties to level the playing field to make it fair," Severini said.\n\nThe National Bike Dealers\' Association\'s Heather Mason said shoppers often check out $2,000 bike from a trusted brand like Trek and then they find a lookalike online for $1,200 - often with lower quality parts, no warranty, no service, and safety risks.\n\n"Reputable brands follow strict safety, labor, and warranty standards," she said in an email to The Associated Press. "De minimis allowed bad actors to dodge these."\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: "India's MSMEs are facing potential supply chain disruptions and factory shutdowns due to a sudden regulatory change by the Ministry of Steel. The new rule mandates Indian Standards compliance and Steel Import Monitoring System registration for raw materials, significantly increasing compliance costs.\n\nA regulatory change by the Ministry of Steel has sparked alarm among India\u2019s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), with the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) warning of potential supply chain disruptions and heavy compliance costs that could lead to widespread factory shutdowns. According to a report by GTRI, the rule\u2014issued on June 13\u2014mandates that raw materials used in the manufacture of finished or semi-finished steel products must now comply with Indian Standards (IS) and be registered on the Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS). The requirement applies to all products covered under India\u2019s Quality Control Orders (QCOs), expanding the compliance burden significantly for importers. Earlier, foreign suppliers only needed BIS certification for finished steel products destined for India. Under the new rule, upstream materials like billets, slabs and hot-rolled coils must also be BIS-certified\u2014even if they\u2019re used by a third country to manufacture finished steel products for Indian buyers. \u201cThis abrupt change could disrupt supply chains and impose heavy compliance costs on MSMEs reliant on imported semi-finished steel,\u201d GTRI said as quoted ANI. It added that the rule has triggered \u201cpanic\u201d in the sector, which fears large-scale losses and plant closures due to the lack of transition time. The report pointed out that many importers had already paid advances for steel shipments due to arrive between June and August. These contracts, signed months in advance, now face the risk of being deemed non-compliant due to the new traceability requirement. To illustrate the complexity, GTRI cited an example: if a Malaysian company supplies steel slabs to a Vietnamese manufacturer, which then converts them into steel sheets for India, both entities must now be BIS-certified. This multi-stage requirement, GTRI warns, creates serious obstacles for global supply chains. Further complicating matters is the apparent exemption granted to finished products such as welded pipes, which are not subject to the same traceability clause. GTRI questioned the need for additional raw material compliance when BIS already certifies finished products after physical inspections at foreign factories. \u201cBIS certification for upstream suppliers can take six to nine months. Yet the Ministry has enforced the new traceability requirement with only three days' notice and no stakeholder consultation,\u201d it said. The think tank has urged the government to reconsider the move, warning that without an extension or relief, the regulation could push many MSMEs into financial distress and lead to a wave of factory closures.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

    text: "India's electric vehicle manufacturing faces disruption due to a widening supply gap of rare earth magnets, exacerbated by China's export restrictions. Indian EV makers struggle to secure magnet imports, essential for EV motor production. The government is exploring solutions like stockpiling and local production incentives to mitigate the crisis and safeguard the EV industry's growth.\n\nA widening supply gap for rare earth magnets is threatening to disrupt India\u2019s electric vehicle manufacturing, with a Jefferies report warning that domestic firms may soon hit a dead-end unless alternative sourcing or stockpiling solutions are found. Several Indian EV makers are reportedly struggling to secure magnet imports from China, which are essential for producing EV motors. The issue has worsened since China imposed fresh export restrictions on key rare earth materials. The Jefferies note cautioned that once existing magnet inventories are exhausted, motor production may face a serious setback, according to ANI. \u201cBased on our conversations with Indian companies, industry is facing a challenge in importing magnets from China and EV motor production could be at risk once the existing magnet inventories get exhausted,\u201d the report stated. The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), in its latest monthly vehicle data release, also raised concern. \u201cGlobal supply-chain headwinds (rare-earth constraints in EV components, geopolitical tensions) may limit urban consumer sentiment and exert cost pressure,\u201d FADA noted. To manage the crisis, some companies are considering importing fully assembled motors directly from China. However, this route brings significant challenges, including changes to the supply chain architecture and the need for fresh homologation approvals for vehicles to comply with Indian regulatory norms. Moreover, shifting to fully built units could weaken the domestic value addition required under the government\u2019s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, potentially affecting company eligibility for subsidies. On April 4, China imposed export controls on six heavy rare earth elements (REEs) and rare earth magnets, citing national security and international commitments such as non-proliferation. While not a complete ban, the new rule requires companies to seek prior Chinese government approval before exporting these materials, adding delays and uncertainty. The report also indicated that the Indian government is actively exploring solutions. Citing a Reuters update, it noted that discussions are underway with private players to build long-term stockpiles of rare earth magnets. Fiscal incentives may be offered to support local production of these critical components. Though termed \"rare,\" these elements\u2014especially lighter ones\u2014are relatively abundant but difficult to extract due to their dispersed presence in the Earth's crust. This makes their processing resource-intensive. The global supply chain for rare earths remains heavily dependent on China, which controls around 70% of mined REEs and nearly 90% of the refined output. It also dominates magnet manufacturing, especially in the heavy rare earth segment. With new controls in place and more restrictions looming, the risk of further disruption remains high\u2014posing a significant threat to India\u2019s fast-growing EV industry.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media",

Inter-ministerial meetings are addressing the entire value chain, from mining to refining, with potential amendments to mining regulations to boost domestic production.\n\nIndia seeks to secure rare-Earth supply chain\n\nThe Centre on Tuesday intensified efforts to secure the supply chain for rare-earth materials critical to manufacturing electric vehicles (EVs), electronics, and defence equipment. In a series of high-level meetings, officials from various ministries came together to review the local availability of these strategic resources. "This inter-ministerial effort will pave the way for India\'s self-reliance in strategic materials crucial for electric vehicles (EVs), electronics, defence and other sectors," said steel and heavy industries minister HD Kumaraswamy in a statement. The move comes as a response to concerns over China curtailing exports of permanent magnets, which are made from rare earth elements (REEs). These magnets are essential components in EV propulsion systems, speakers, power windows, and generators used in renewable energy infrastructure. The supply squeeze has raised fears of potential disruptions in EV production in India. Coal and mines minister G Kishan Reddy and Kumaraswamy jointly chaired the inter-ministerial meetings, which also involved representatives from the atomic energy and commerce ministries, reported ET. Reddy posted on X that discussions focused on strengthening the value chain, from mining and refining to final use. To accelerate domestic capabilities, the government is considering amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. These changes aim to support the critical mineral mission and boost production capacity. Additionally, the Centre expects commercially viable domestic production of rare earth permanent magnets in small quantities later this year, marking a key step toward reducing reliance on imports.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: 'Piyush Goyal has called China\'s rare earth export restrictions a global wake-up call, urging supply chain diversification. He highlighted India\'s efforts to develop alternative sources and become a reliable partner, addressing potential challenges for the automotive and white goods sectors. The government is supporting domestic production and exploring technological solutions to reduce dependence on Chinese materials.\n\nNEW DELHI: Union minister Piyush Goyal has described China\'s restrictions on rare earth exports as a "wake-up call for the whole world," urging countries to diversify their supply chains. He said India is actively working to develop alternative sources and position itself as a reliable partner for global businesses looking to reduce dependence on Chinese suppliers. Speaking in Switzerland during his official visit, the commerce and industry minister said, "This situation serves as a wake-up call for all those who have become over-reliant on certain geographies.\u201d "It\'s a wake-up call for the whole world that you need trusted partners in your supply chain," he added, according to news agency ANI. Goyal further acknowledged that China\'s restrictions on rare earth exports will create short-term challenges, especially for India\'s automotive and white goods sectors. However, he expressed confidence that joint efforts by the government, industry, and innovators can turn these challenges into long-term opportunities. He laid out a detailed plan to address the situation. This includes diplomatic talks through the Indian embassy\'s ongoing discussions with Chinese officials and the commerce ministry\'s efforts to find alternative supply sources. At the same time, the government is ramping up support for Indian Rare Earths Limited, providing the necessary resources to increase domestic production. Goyal also said that the current technological advancements could offer alternative solutions to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth materials. "There are some technologies that India is developing," he said, emphasising the collaborative approach involving government, industry, startups, and innovators. "We are all working as a team and remain confident that while there may be challenges in the short run, we will emerge as winners in the medium to long term," he added. The minister considered the present disruption as an opportunity to strengthen India\'s manufacturing sector, and expressed confidence that this situation would enhance awareness about self-sufficiency."There is an opportunity even in this crisis and challenge," Goyal continued. "More and more companies, businesses, and people in India will recognise that it is important to be self-reliant and to have trusted partners in supply chains. Increasingly, the world today wants India to be part of their supply chain because we are seen as a trusted partner," he added. The automotive industry, heavily dependent on rare earth magnets from China for EV components, has urged the government to speed up approval processes for imports. These magnets are crucial for manufacturing passenger cars and other automotive parts. China, which controls over 90% of global magnet production, poses major supply chain risks for many industries. Starting April 4, new Chinese rules require special export permits for seven rare earth elements and related magnetic products. "There are clearly issues around the suspension of permanent magnet supplies from China to India, which will particularly affect our auto sector and several white goods manufacturers," Goyal said. "Some companies have submitted their applications, and we hope that pragmatic considerations will prevail and they will receive the necessary approvals," he added.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: 'NEW DELHI: As Indian auto industry faces a magnet supply crunch, following restrictions placed by China, a group of companies, including some homegrown advanced material entities, have come forward to build in-house supply chains. The companies have made presentations to govt, including the heavy industries ministry, and assured building of supplies within India to reduce dependence on China. "The companies include Midwest Advanced Materials, Entellus Industries, and public sector Indian Rare Earths (IREL)," sources have told TOI. The sources said that heavy industries secretary Kamran Rizvi has also taken presentations from companies as govt develops strategies for indigenous capabilities in magnet production. "Midwest Advanced Materials made a presentation about their plans to produce rare earth magnets in India with a capacity of 500 tonnes per annum. They forecast that by end of 2026, they will be able to produce custom-made rare earth magnets for the industry," one of the sources said. Entellus, a UK-headquartered company with primary operations in India, also made a presentation to govt, detailing their plans to produce rare earth magnets. "They have told officials that their plant is ready to produce the magnetic powder but will still take some time to produce industry-grade magnets," the source said. IREL, which was among the last to make its presentation, informed govt that once production begins, they will be able to match China\'s rates. "However, the company said that ore present in Indian geography is 100 times less than in China, the US, and Australia," the source said. Companies also told govt that magnet production in India was shut down over the past two decades due to proliferation of cheaper Chinese supplies. "The industry members requested govt to support companies in setting up magnet production by providing incentives and monetary benefits," the source said. Secretary Rizvi told the companies to make "realistic statements about magnet production" as potential customers in the auto sector will suffer due to incorrect assessments. The auto industry has also requested potential local producers to provide a firm timeline on supplies, if possible, emphasising that their production line depends on quick procurement. The situation for the auto industry has deteriorated over the past few months as no Indian auto component or vehicle company has managed to get approval from the Chinese govt for procuring rare earth magnets. Also, there has been "no clarity as yet" on any timeline for a confirmed meeting with representatives of Chinese govt, despite intervention of Indian officials. The applications for sourcing magnets have been filed mainly by parts manufacturers who provide fully-built sophisticated component assemblies such as speedometers, electric motors, e-axles, electric water pumps, automatic transmission kits, speakers, sensors, and ignition coils (used in engines). The request for a meeting with Chinese representatives is being pursued not just by industry bodies of component makers (Auto Component Manufacturers Association) and vehicle manufacturers (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers), but also facilitated by officials in ministries.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFollow Us On Social Media',

    text: 'Between 2021 and 2023, the world witnessed just how vulnerable global supply chains can be. Factory shutdowns during the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and large-scale logistical disruptions exposed the fragility of these interconnected networks. As the ripple effects impacted nearly every industry, it became clear that a smarter, more adaptive approach was urgently needed. For Hatim Kagalwala\u2014a data science expert who has led machine learning initiatives at Amazon and American Express\u2014the answer lies not only in technological innovation but in deeply understanding and responding to customer behavior.\n\nAdvt\n\nIn 2024, he authored a pivotal study titled "Using Machine Learning to Model Supply Chain Management." In it, Kagalwala emphasized that true resilience starts with visibility, adaptability, and informed decision-making. His research demonstrated how machine learning models can simulate complex supply networks, enabling businesses to test various scenarios and proactively prepare for disruptions. However, he believes that ML\u2019s greatest strength lies in its ability to monitor and respond to customer demand in real time.\n\n\u201cData science isn\u2019t just about algorithms\u2014it\u2019s about understanding customer behavior and solving business problems in a reliable, responsible, and impactful way,\u201d he explains.\n\nRather than focusing solely on backend logistics, Kagalwala has developed forecasting models that leverage customer data\u2014such as purchase history, browsing behavior, and seasonal trends\u2014to align inventory with anticipated demand. This minimizes overstock, prevents costly shortages, and ensures products are available when and where customers need them. To him, effective supply chain management isn\u2019t just about speed\u2014it\u2019s about delivering the right products at the right time, based on a deep understanding of customer needs.\n\nThe global supply chain crisis exposed the limitations of traditional forecasting systems, which relied on static assumptions and struggled to adapt to sudden, large-scale disruptions. These systems failed to anticipate rapid shifts in consumer demand, and just-in-time inventory strategies collapsed under pressure. This, Kagalwala argues, is precisely where machine learning offers a critical advantage\u2014by enabling more adaptive, responsive, and data-driven decision-making.\n\nAdvt\n\nMachine learning algorithms can estimate demand using real-time data\u2014such as weather changes, social trends, or regional events. They also have the capability to detect potential disruptions across vast networks, including shipping delays or supplier inconsistencies, before they escalate. When these insights are combined with dynamic routing and real-time logistics optimization, businesses can respond to unexpected events faster and more intelligently.\n\nEqually important is risk modeling. By analyzing geopolitical developments, financial indicators, and supplier histories, machine learning can uncover hidden vulnerabilities in supply networks, allowing companies to adjust proactively. \u201cResilient supply chains,\u201d Kagalwala notes, \u201care customer-centric and data-driven. They must be able to sense, learn, and adapt.\u201d\n\nAdvt\n\nLooking ahead, he envisions supply chains evolving into dynamic ecosystems\u2014responsive, decentralized, and deeply attuned to customer needs. His ongoing research explores how real-time customer data can be integrated into machine learning frameworks, ensuring that technology doesn\u2019t just optimize for speed but also for accuracy and relevance.\n\nThrough this fusion of data science and human insight, Hatim Kagalwala is helping redefine what resilience means in today\u2019s volatile world. His work charts a new path for supply chains\u2014making them smarter, more adaptable, and always connected to the people they serve.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\n\nAll about ETCIO industry right on your smartphone!\n\nDownload the ETCIO App and get the Realtime updates and Save your favourite articles.',

    text: 'Amazon is developing humanoid robots that could soon replace human delivery workers, with plans to have the machines "spring out" of Rivian electric vans to deliver packages directly to customers\' doors.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has constructed a "humanoid park" testing facility at its San Francisco office, according to a report by The Information. The indoor obstacle course, roughly the size of a coffee shop, features a Rivian delivery van where Amazon will test various humanoid robots in simulated delivery scenarios.\n\nThe company is developing artificial intelligence software to power these robots while using hardware from external manufacturers. One robot being tested is a $16,000 unit from China-based Unitree, though Amazon plans to evaluate multiple humanoid models during the trials.\n\nAdvt\n\nOnce testing concludes at the facility, Amazon intends to conduct real-world "field trips" where robots will attempt actual package deliveries to homes. The robots would travel in the back of Amazon\'s fleet of over 20,000 Rivian electric vans, potentially speeding up delivery times by allowing simultaneous drops at multiple addresses.\n\nThis initiative represents a significant expansion of Amazon\'s existing robotics program. The company already uses autonomous robots extensively in its warehouses and has previously trialed Agility Robotics\' humanoid "Digit" robot for logistics tasks. However, deploying humanoid robots for last-mile delivery in uncontrolled outdoor environments presents new technical challenges.\n\nThe development coincides with Amazon\'s broader AI push announced Wednesday, which includes agentic AI systems for warehouse operations and generative AI for enhanced delivery mapping. The company is also working on smart eyeglasses for drivers that would provide hands-free navigation and delivery instructions.\n\nAmazon\'s humanoid delivery robot project could eventually impact hundreds of thousands of delivery jobs globally, as the company seeks to fully automate package delivery from warehouse to doorstep. The timeline for real-world deployment remains unclear, with testing still in early phases.\n\nBy ,\n\nTIMESOFINDIA.COM\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\n\nAll about ETCIO industry right on your smartphone!\n\nDownload the ETCIO App and get the Realtime updates and Save your favourite articles.',

Instead, they ask complete, natural questions, such as \u201cWhat are the best high-quality shoes for running?\u201d or \u201cShow me kurti options under Rs 1,000\u201d or \u201cShow me running shoes that can be delivered in 2 days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese and more are real examples of how customers are using AI in their digital commerce journeys,\u201d says Makhija. \u201cEvolving user behaviour, expansion in the number of online channels, growing emphasis on enhanced user experience and the need to drive higher operational efficiencies are driving AI adoption in multiple ways,\u201d he observes.\n\nTo stay visible in AI-driven conversations, he says, product data needs to mirror the way people speak with natural phrases like \u2018reliable running shoes for daily jogs\u2019 or \u2018suitable for gym workouts\u2019, which mimic how shoppers describe their needs in AI tools. \u201cThe more closely product information matches the way people actually describe what they\u2019re looking for, the more likely it is for the product to be recommended by conversational AI tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI can enable an enhanced search experience by using natural language processing (NLP), which helps understand customers\u2019 search intent while offering conversational search. It can allow customers to refine queries through dialogues, like a discussion with a human salesperson,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvt\n\nAdditionally, AI is helping these demands sync up with the inventory, says Makhija. \u201cWhen a customer looks for running shoes that can be delivered in two days, it will look at available data and give the results. If a brand\u2019s inventory is not synced across channels, the choice will not show up, even if it is available,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cReal-time inventory visibility is no longer an operational strength; it is the starting point in an AI-powered shopping world. While there are a growing number of sales channels like multiple marketplaces, quick-commerce chains, brand websites and apps, physical stores and omni-channel integrations that connect brands to sellers, the inventory is typically held in a few locations only. Technology helps track real-time inventory across various points of sale and storage,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvt\n\nAt the same time, he points out that AI can simplify the complexity of selling on multiple e-commerce platforms by automating product listings to ensure consistent descriptions and images across platforms.\n\nFor automating operations, e-commerce enablement platform Shiprocket has recently launched an AI-integrated model context protocol (MCP) server. This server allows AI agents to perform key operations, such as checking shipping rates or tracking orders, all through a single line of instruction.\n\nSaahil Goel, Co-founder and CEO of Shiprocket, says that India has a very good opportunity with AI due to the abundance of unstructured data in the country. This includes different accents, languages, and voices, which means that many things that could be automated in the West remain unautomated in India.\n\nAdvt\n\n\u201cAdditionally, India has struggled with DIY (Do-It-Yourself) in the past, and it still hasn\u2019t accepted it to a great degree. I do think that can change with AI. Right now, the merchant depends on service providers for many things, all of which can come down to a prompt. Today\u2019s AI-powered co-pilots are very intelligent; they can be connected to a merchant\u2019s business, their ad account, their marketplaces, Google Analytics, etc. A merchant can simply ask the co-pilot to do a reconciliation or ask, \u2018How much money does Amazon owe me?\u2019 and they will get accurate answers. SMEs could have a McKinsey consultant in their pocket,\u201d he says, adding that often SMEs struggle with not knowing, and then the cost to deliver that knowledge to them is very high in a service-orientated market.\n\nAI also helps with eliminating errors, especially in logistics, such as getting the right state and PIN codes, he says.\n\nMakhija also highlights that logistics accounts for a substantial expense in e-commerce operations. Different products, geographies, modes of payment, values of products and more determine the right courier selection for a certain order. AI models predict which courier will deliver fastest or with the least risk of RTO (Return to Origin) for a specific package or geography.\n\n\u201cFor businesses using multiple delivery partners, AI engines help allocate deliveries across different courier partners based on service levels, area efficiency, or cost. Shipway is Unicommerce\u2019s logistics management platform that provides both courier aggregation and courier automation services. Shipway\u2019s smart courier automation services help it dynamically suggest the best carrier based on current rate cards, package weight, distance, and urgency. This helps businesses reduce RTOs, improve delivery SLAs and manage costs,\u201d he says.\n\nHe adds that AI can also help in RTO (return-to-origin) reduction and fraud detection. AI helps in predictive analytics to determine likely failure chances of a delivery based on address patterns, COD risk, or past delivery success. \u201cAI can predict the likelihood of delivery failure and automate proactive action like calling the customer in advance. AI can also increase the efficiency of fraud detection by flagging suspicious delivery patterns, like unusually high failed deliveries from a specific area or user,\u201d he says.\n\nAI has been a great help not just for sellers but for consumers as well. As per Praveen Govindu, Partner, Deloitte India, AI now permeates nearly every aspect of the digital retail experience. From bot-led customer support to reduced cart abandonment, AI has a lot to offer to enhance consumer experience.\n\n\u201cVirtual assistants and chatbots now handle a wide range of customer interactions\u2014from answering questions to guiding users through purchases and resolving post-purchase issues, improving conversion rates and post-purchase satisfaction. AI also tackles the persistent problem of cart abandonment by sending smart, personalised reminders and offering targeted discounts on abandoned cart products. Real-time chatbots also step in to resolve last-minute doubts, nudging customers to complete purchases,\u201d he says.\n\nHe continues, \u201cAI-driven AR (Augmented Reality) allows customers to visualise how products like cosmetics, clothing or furniture will look like on real users/set-ups, bridging the gap between online convenience and in-store confidence.\u201d\n\nHowever, this technology comes with its own set of challenges, such as outdated data quality, over-automation, integration issues and privacy risks.\n\nAI can automate only what is well-defined. If business processes are flawed, automation will simply make bad outcomes happen faster. Over-automation can also lead to inefficiencies and customer frustration if not properly managed. Further, integrating AI with existing systems can be difficult, especially with legacy infrastructure causing delays and additional costs. Implementing AI involves significant upfront investment, ongoing maintenance and employee training. \u201cThese can be barriers for small businesses,\u201d he says. He also points out the lack of human touch.\n\nAccording to Deloitte India\u2019s Govindu, AI cannot think strategically, create original ideas or form emotional connections with customers. \u201cIt only excels at well-defined and repetitive tasks.\u201d\n\nAdds Shiprocket\u2019s Goel, saying that AI is also capable of generating fake content and fake reviews and thus has the potential to be abused. Interestingly, it is also good at catching these fake reviews and accounts and checking whether they are spam.\n\nNevertheless, the future looks promising as per the experts. Goel believes that AI\u2019s applications will go deep into regional tier II and tier III markets using video and voice-based intelligence.\n\n\u201cToday, when we work with brands or B2C firms, there are typically 4-5 segments\u2014male, female, urban, non-urban, etc., and their combinations. But, in reality, there could be 1000s. You could do thousands of creatives for these thousands of people. With AI, it becomes possible to run the same ad in different versions as per every city,\u201d he says.\n\nTalking about the future use cases, Govindu said that there will be a lot more autonomous product tagging and catalog management as well as real-time profiling and customer targeting. AI will automatically tag, categorise, and update product listing based on image and text recognition, he says.\n\n\u201cBy analysing real-time data streams like browsing patterns, cursor movements, and session interactions, AI constructs evolving customer profiles and plans hyper personalised targeting strategies. For example, AI can monitor micro interactions (scroll depth, hover duration) to infer intent adjusting recommendations mid-session. It can also analyse externally integrated data like weather, location, and device-type to tailor offers,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the occasion of World MSME Day on June 27, 2025, ET Digital will also open registrations for its sixth edition of the ET MSME Awards 2025.

    text: "AI is powering advancements across industries, with millions of potential customers and demand for innovative solutions. As business leaders move from experimentation to adoption, their questions are getting more sophisticated. Aside from ROI and tips for running pilots, they want to know more about successful use cases applied to specific verticals.\n\nThe adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is set to boost productivity in India's USD 254-billion software industry by 43 per cent to 45 per cent over the next five years, according to a survey by EY India. The productivity surge will be driven by the IT sector's integration of GenAI internally and the growing number of client projects moving from proof of concept to full-scale production.\n\nAdvt\n\nWhile there are commonalities, the specifics of productivity increases can vary between industries. For a professor, it means more time to focus on research. On the factory floor, it translates into speeding up processes.\n\nWhile the scope of AI\u2019s impact spans countless industries, there are a few most immediate and visible transformations taking place in sectors like retail, manufacturing, and education\u2014offering a glimpse into how AI is reshaping business outcomes and operational models in these domains.\n\nAI in Retail: Smarter, faster, more personal experiences\n\nAI is reshaping the retail landscape, creating more personalized shopping journeys and efficient operations. According to KPMG\u2019s latest report on AI-driven transformation in retail, 55% of retailers have achieved a return on investment (ROI) of more than 10%, while 21% have recorded returns exceeding 30%. AI is making its mark across critical functions such as IT (61%), marketing (53%), and customer service (53%), highlighting its deepening role in reshaping the industry.\n\nDespite early skepticism and cautious adoption, AI is now proving its value in retail, driving efficiency, innovation, and cost reduction. The study found that 67% of retailers have leveraged AI to enhance operational efficiency, while 47% have introduced AI-driven innovations, from hyper-personalized customer experiences to dynamic pricing and supply chain optimization.\n\nRetailers are now using artificial intelligence (AI) to implement real-time pricing strategies, thereby, dynamically adjust discounts based on data analytics. This is of particular significance as pricing has become more fluid than ever with the rise of e-commerce giants and quick-commerce platforms.\n\nAdvt\n\nRetailers can use AI to recommend products, tailor marketing campaigns and improve personalization. IDC reports that nearly 65% of retailers are investing in GenAI, focusing on use cases like content generation. Additionally, customer service tools like virtual assistants reduce the time modern retailers spend on manual tasks.\n\nAI in Manufacturing and Industrial Operations: A New Era of Efficiency\n\nAccording to a report by KPMG titled Intelligent Manufacturing, 93 per cent believe that manufacturing organisations that fully integrate AI will gain a significant competitive edge over those that do not. The AI opportunity for manufacturers goes beyond production and extends to encompass precision and agility.\n\nAdvt\n\nMaintenance and quality control are critical manufacturing areas that benefit from AI. AI-driven monitoring systems ensure machines are operating at peak performance and identify potential failures before they occur. These algorithms pinpoint defects during production, which improves product quality and minimizes waste. Factories can reduce downtime and maintenance expenses, improving productivity.\n\nOn the supply chain, real-time data enables manufacturers to adjust logistics, sourcing strategies and production schedules to improve delivery times. AI is also capable of analyzing historical data to forecast demand and enhance planning and inventory management.\n\nAdvt\n\nThere\u2019s another opportunity that seemed futuristic a couple of years ago: AI-powered robotics and automation. Collaborative robots can take on repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, freeing up workers to focus on higher-value work, like improving production processes or ensuring quality control.\n\nAI in Education and Research: Personalized Learning\n\nAI is transforming education through personalized learning and innovative teaching methods.

Teachers save time and students stay engaged with AI tools that personalize the learning process, making it more fun and dynamic. The classroom presents a unique opportunity \u2013 not to replace human teachers, but to enhance their capabilities in unprecedented ways. According to World Economic Forum, this transformation is already underway: The global AI in education market is expected to grow from $5.18 billion in 2024 to $112.3 billion by 2034.\n\nIn the realm of data analysis, AI is proving invaluable for educators and institutions. Predictive analytics allows educators to identify students who need support and allocate resources to these efforts.\n\nBeyond the classroom, AI is supporting academic and scientific research. By simplifying data analysis, AI accelerates discovery and fosters innovation. AI agents are powerful research partners that quickly gather preliminary insights and analyze vast amounts of data that would take scientists far more time to process.\n\nEducators have a lot to gain from AI adoption. Beyond simple automation, AI creates personalized and immersive learning experiences. AI is helping educators shift focus from administrative burdens to meaningful academic interactions.\n\nStep into the Future of AI\n\nAI gets better and acquires more capabilities every day, which means the economic impact can only grow from here. Industries like retail, manufacturing and education have an opportunity to transform their practices. To stay ahead, leaders must act now, prioritizing AI tools to improve efficiency and unlock opportunities. Now is the time to take advantage of AI as the foundation for competitive differentiation.

From predictive maintenance to intelligent resource allocation, AI-driven automation enhances scalability, reduces downtime, and significantly improves operational efficiency. AI servers now form the backbone of new-generation data centers, capable of handling complex and high-volume workloads across industries.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey report, AI-led automation can help data centers reduce operational costs by up to 30%, improve energy efficiency, and enhance service delivery. Moreover, the deployment of AI to manage data traffic, detect anomalies, and optimize cooling systems ensures smoother, uninterrupted service in a 24/7 digital world.\n\nThe AI-Cloud synergy: A game changer for Indian enterprises\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between AI and cloud computing is transforming how enterprises operate. AI-enhanced cloud platforms allow organizations to automate workflows, derive actionable insights from large datasets, and create hyper-personalized customer experiences. This transformation is especially significant in India, where digital-first business models are taking root across sectors. For instance, leading Indian banks are using AI-driven cloud tools to streamline customer service, detect fraud, and personalize loan offerings. In manufacturing, AI-enabled predictive analytics on cloud platforms is minimizing machine downtime and boosting productivity.\n\nAdvt\n\nAs businesses modernize IT infrastructures to support AI workloads, cloud service providers\u2014both global hyperscalers and local alternatives are expanding their offerings to meet the demand for AI-specific processing power and storage capabilities.\n\nSustainability and energy use: An urgent priority\n\nHowever, this rapid transformation also comes with an environmental cost. Data centers currently consume around 1.5% of global electricity, and the rise of energy-intensive AI workloads and cryptocurrency mining is pushing this figure higher. In India, where power infrastructure can be strained, this raises concerns about long-term sustainability.\n\nAdvt\n\nTo address this, companies are innovating with sustainable infrastructure. Green data centers, powered by a mix of grid electricity and renewable sources like solar and wind, are becoming more mainstream. Operators are also adopting advanced cooling technologies, such as liquid cooling and AI-regulated thermal systems, to reduce energy consumption.\n\nA recent NASSCOM report emphasized that India\u2019s green data center market is expected to reach $4.5 billion by 2027, underlining the urgency for environmentally conscious development.\n\nBridging the talent gap\n\nIndia\u2019s rise as a digital infrastructure powerhouse depends not just on technology but also on talent. According to Uptime Institute, the global data center workforce will need to grow to 2.3 million by 2025, and India is expected to contribute a significant portion to fill this gap.\n\nAdvt\n\nYet, there remains a major skills shortage in AI, cloud computing, and data center management. The MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and IT) has recently launched several public-private initiatives focused on upskilling professionals in emerging technologies, including AI and cloud. Collaboration between the industry and academic institutions will be key to building a pipeline of skilled professionals who can support India's growing digital economy.\n\nTo sum up: Its a defining opportunity for India\n\nThe integration of AI and cloud computing is transforming the data center ecosystem, and India stands at the cusp of becoming a global leader in this space. Strategic investments, a strong focus on sustainability, and talent development are crucial to navigating this next phase.\n\nAs enterprises reassess their IT strategies, they must embrace this disruption to unlock new value. Whether it\u2019s through AI-enabled automation, sustainable data operations, or agile cloud platforms, the path forward is clear: India must innovate, scale, and lead.\n\nThe author is Sarthak Hooda, Founder & CEO, Neon Cloud.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCIO does not necessarily subscribe to it.

A more aggressive rollout could potentially escalate losses, similar to Blinkit and Instamart, which together added over 600 dark stores in Q4 FY2025, incurring capital expenditures of Rs 317 crore (Blinkit) and Rs 425 crore (Instamart).\n\nBy concentrating on top-tier cities, Flipkart aims to minimise operational costs while maintaining a significant presence in high-demand areas.\n\nAlso Read: Quick commerce price war: Rivals offering steep discounts to capture market, says Swiggy CFO\n\nAI leadership roles up 40-60% in FY25 as talent demand soars\n\nLeadership roles in artificial intelligence (AI) have surged by 40-60% year-on-year in FY25, according to data from staffing firms.\n\nDriving the news:\n\nFirms across IT, consulting, global capability centres, BFSI, and healthcare sectors are leading demand.\n\nStartups in ecommerce and fintech are setting up dedicated AI units.\n\nDeeptech and generative AI-focused startups from multinational firms are establishing AI centres in India.\n\nYes, and:\n\nAdvt\n\nKey designations include chief AI officer, head of AI/ML, VP of AI engineering, VP of AI strategy/innovation, director, applied AI or innovation, and AI product head.\n\nTop recruiters for these roles include Accenture, LTIMindtree, IBM, Deloitte, and Wipro.\n\nPayout: Companies are increasingly linking compensation to business impact, with top talent moving faster into CXO or P&L-aligned positions.\n\nChief AI officers are offered between Rs 1.2-2.5 crore annually.\n\nAccording to Quess data, heads of AI/ML typically earn between Rs 80 lakhs and Rs 1.5 crore.\n\nVPs of GenAI/ML are in the Rs 70 lakhs to Rs 1.2 crore range.\n\nAlso Read: Workers using AI tools seen as less competent: Study\n\nET Explainer: Behind UPI-first digital payment apps\u2019 plan to revamp mobile wallet operations\n\nPaytm chief executive officer Vijay Shekhar Sharma told market analysts last week that the company is close to a breakthrough in reviving its mobile wallet operations.

    text: 'Salesforce, today announced the expansion of its collaboration with Air India with the adoption of Salesforce Agentforce. As part of its ongoing digital transformation, Air India is among the first airlines to go-live with Agentforce, leveraging it to automate key customer service processes. The first roll out of Agentforce in customer service will help drive faster resolution of a class of refund issues, and elevate its customer experience at scale.\n\nAir India has been a long-standing Salesforce customer, using Service Cloud, Sales Cloud, Data Cloud and Einstein AI to power its customer engagement and business operations. The latest expansion marks a strategic step towards becoming an AI-infused airline, focused on delivering seamless, responsive, and personalised experiences for its passengers using emerging agentic AI technologies bolstered by its extensive data fabric.\n\nAdvt\n\nAddressing a high-impact customer challenge with AI-powered automation\n\nRefund requests often require multiple handoffs between Air India\u2019s contact center, refunds team, and the customer, which can occasionally slow down resolution times.\n\nBy deploying Salesforce Agentforce, Air India is reimagining this process through adoption of agentic AI. The solution streamlines and accelerates the end-to-end handling of such requests \u2014 automating routine steps, reducing human effort, and enabling agents to focus on higher-value interactions. Customers now benefit from faster resolutions, timely refund processing, and proactive updates.\n\nFollowing the successful implementation of their first use case, Air India plans to scale the use of Agentforce across other contact center operations and customer touchpoints, including voice-based interactions, over the next several months.\n\nComments on the news:\n\nArundhati Bhattacharya, President & CEO at Salesforce - South Asia, said, "Agentforce represents the next frontier of customer service \u2014 where AI works alongside humans to deliver faster, smarter, and more personalized experiences at scale. With its adoption of Agentforce, Air India is setting a new benchmark for modern, AI-driven customer engagement in the aviation industry globally. Their vision of becoming an AI-first airline aligns perfectly with Salesforce\u2019s commitment to help businesses automate at scale, deliver faster service, and foster loyalty through every interaction.\u201d\n\nAdvt\n\nDr. Satya Ramaswamy, Chief Digital & Technology Officer for Air India, said, \u201cWe are happy to partner with Salesforce in pioneering Agentforce in the aviation industry, starting with transforming how we manage certain classes of refund cases using cutting-edge Agentic AI \u2014 drastically reducing resolution times. For our guests, this means instant acknowledgment of these claims with real-time updates and a seamless experience across all touchpoints, reinforcing trust and valuing their loyalty. This isn\u2019t just a technological leap\u2014it\u2019s a customer-first commitment, delivering faster, smarter, and more empathetic service to our valued guests at every step.\u201d\n\nAdvt\n\nPowering Air India\u2019s broader digital transformation\n\nAgentforce complements Air India\u2019s broader digital transformation roadmap, where Salesforce continues to be a trusted technology partner.

While the company's results were better than analysts had expected, CEO Tim Cook said estimated tariffs will add about $900 million in costs to the quarter ending in June if rates do not change.\n\nCook also outlined changes to the company's supply chain to minimize the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war.\n\nAmazon.com shares were down 2.5% after it reported first-quarter cloud revenue growth and forecast operating income below estimates.\n\nAdvt\n\nDuring the regular session, U.S. technology-related stocks including many involved in artificial intelligence rose sharply following stronger-than-expected results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms late in the previous session.

    text: "Highlights\n\nNvidia Corporation's Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang will headline the 2025 Computex electronics conference in Taipei, which will also draw significant attention due to the presence of United States President Donald Trump amidst ongoing discussions about reshaping the global trade order.\n\nAmidst the challenges posed by the Trump administration's tariff regime, companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company are committing to significant investments in domestic chip manufacturing, indicating a potential shift in the geography of chip production.\n\nIntel Corporation's newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan is focusing on rebuilding partnerships and customer relations at Computex, as the company seeks to regain market share and compete effectively against rivals like Nvidia Corporation and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nNvidia Corp.\u2019s Jensen Huang headlines the 2025 edition of Asia\u2019s biggest electronics conference, for years a showcase for his company\u2019s cutting-edge AI chips and the companies lining up to buy them. This year, however, the spotlight may well be on another far bigger personality: US President Donald Trump.\n\nComputex kicks off Monday in Taipei, and as in years past will draw industry chieftains from Huang and Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s Cristiano Amon to Young Liu of Foxconn, which makes the bulk of the world\u2019s iPhones and Nvidia servers. But while last year\u2019s event was a celebration of the post-ChatGPT AI boom, executives this time are likely grappling with the uncertainty of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to reshape the global trade order \u2014 disrupting a decades-old model for tech manufacturing.\n\nnullThis year\u2019s exhibition will of course feature the hardware required to bring artificial intelligence to life. Apart from Nvidia chips, that includes server racks assembled by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn; power components from Delta Electronics Inc.; and datacenter cooling systems from Asia Vital Components Co. But while they tout new products onstage, these companies are also confronting profound questions about the US administration\u2019s tariff regime.\n\nAdvt\n\nHere are the key themes to watch out for this week.\n\nThe shifting geography of chip manufacturing\n\nTrump wants manufacturing back home. To that end, the White House has secured major chipmaking commitments, most notably an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. As TSMC builds out its Arizona operations with more production lines, supply chain players are also joining it in the US \u2014 and accelerating those plans because of the new tariffs.\n\nAsia\u2019s biggest electronics companies may also find new opportunity in the Middle East. In the week before Computex, a US delegation led by the president \u2014 and including tech luminaries Huang, Elon Musk and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman \u2014 visited Saudi Arabia\u2019s Riyadh with lofty promises of new trade deals. Alongside a relaxation of AI chip export rules, the visit underlines the Middle East\u2019s growing importance as a player in the AI field.\n\n\u201cThe new focus on export rules around China and Huawei means more opportunity for Taiwan,\u201d said Taipei-based industry analyst Dan Nystedt.\n\nAI\u2019s questionable payoff\n\nFrom Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Nvidia and Qualcomm, the development of generative artificial intelligence was heralded at Computex last year as comparable to the advent of the internet.\n\nConsumers haven\u2019t responded with the same enthusiasm. Smartphone shipments grew by only 2.4% and PCs by an even slimmer 1.8% over the holiday quarter, according to industry tracker IDC. The promises from the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. about how transformative AI would be in day-to-day life have not come to pass. Apple Inc. hasn\u2019t even rolled out its full AI suite for iPhones yet. So executives at Computex will face questions about when the payoff is supposed to come.\n\nAdvt\n\nThey\u2019ll also have to address concerns about an AI bubble. Investment from the biggest US internet firms remains elevated. Yet Microsoft Corp. has pulled back on some of its expansion plans, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Joe Tsai warned against building vast data centers without knowing their purpose.\n\nIntel\u2019s mew man in charge\n\nLip-Bu Tan, the newly appointed chief executive officer of Intel Corp., won\u2019t be at Computex in a formal capacity as his company won\u2019t conduct its traditional keynote address. But he\u2019ll likely be doing more meetings than anyone at the show as he continues his survey of partners and customers. He\u2019s said recently that he\u2019s doing countless meetings each day and having two or three business dinners trying to get insight.\n\nAdvt\n\nTan is currently weighing options to reform the storied US chipmaker. Intel is still the biggest provider of PC and server processors, though it\u2019s losing market share. He\u2019ll work to persuade customers of TSMC that Intel\u2019s factories are a viable alternative and that the US manufacturer \u2014 historically a rival \u2014 can be a trusted partner. The financial strain of predecessor Pat Gelsinger\u2019s spending on a turnaround plan tanked Intel\u2019s shares, particularly because it hasn\u2019t deliver tangible benefits yet. Now, Tan is rebooting everything with a focus on better execution.\n\n\u201cComputex is historically such a PC-focused event, and yet Intel seems to be sitting it out quietly,\u201d said IDC analyst Bryan Ma. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable given everything else going on in the organization right now, but their absence is notable given all of their talk about AI PCs last year.\u201d\n\nAdvt\n\nTan, who served as CEO of chip-design software maker Cadence Design Systems Inc. for 12 years, has decades of experience investing and making deals in the semiconductor industry. At and around Computex, he\u2019ll work to reassure and recruit partners for the effort to close ground on Nvidia and TSMC.\n\nFoxconn\u2019s debut\n\nFoxconn is making an unusually prominent appearance. Chairman Liu will host a keynote presentation on Tuesday, likely underscoring its growing role as an AI server assembler. In previous iterations of the show, the company has been represented by subsidiaries like Ingrasys Technology Inc.\n\nnull\n\nFoxconn is working to diversify its revenue away from assembling smartphones and other consumer electronics. It\u2019s developed an automotive division and hopes to collect bigger orders for electric vehicles. That venture gained a significant customer this month, with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. ordering a made-in-Taiwan EV for Australia and New Zealand. The company is also keen on advancing robotics.\n\n\u201cOf course AI plus robots, AI plus robots,\u201d Liu said about the focus at Computex.\n\nWhat\u2019s next from Nvidia\n\n\u201cMy first night in Taipei is always dinner with C.C.,\u201d Jensen Huang said on Friday, emerging from a restaurant alongside TSMC CEO and Chairman C.C. Wei. The Nvidia boss remains a larger-than-life personality in Taiwan, with crowds following his every move. Investors will be keen to hear more about the chip designer\u2019s strategy to expand its reach.\n\nThe company has been forthcoming with plans to upgrade its AI chips on a roughly annual basis, and Huang has also talked about the potential of AI in the robotics industry. Microsoft\u2019s developer event, Build, is taking place the same week over in Seattle, and speculation has grown in recent times about Nvidia joining Qualcomm in building more AI-capable, Arm-based chips for PCs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping my eyes and ears open for whatever Nvidia and MediaTek might confirm around their rumored Windows-on-Arm solution,\u201d said IDC\u2019s Ma. That might further challenge Intel\u2019s traditional stronghold.\n\nIn the days leading up to Computex, Huang joined a US delegation to the Middle East led by the president, lauding the opening up of trade. The scrapping of Biden-era AI chip rules will help the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia acquire more of Nvidia\u2019s industry-leading technology and expand their capabilities in artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWith proper forecasting, we would be able to build the necessary technologies for everyone,\u201d Huang said to Bloomberg News on Saturday.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals.\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter to get latest insights & analysis in your inbox.\n\nAll about ETCIO industry right on your smartphone!\n\nDownload the ETCIO App and get the Realtime updates and Save your favourite articles.",

    text: 'Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared the trade war with China "done" Wednesday, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Chinese goods will be locked in at the current 55% rate without additional increases. Even if the resolution to the battle with the biggest U.S. foe in Trump\'s trade war is real, the damage to the supply chain, the U.S. consumer and the economy will remain, say logistics and retail industry executives.\n\nThe latest headlines in the trade war come amid a slowdown in orders as the early 2025 period of tariff front-loading ended and firms across the economy prepared for a potential slowdown in the U.S.\n\n"I think there\'s a chance real numbers will deteriorate soon," Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, the nation\'s largest bank, said at a Morgan Stanley event Tuesday, before the Trump administration\'s most recent comments.\n\nAlan Baer, CEO of logistics firm OL USA, said the existing 55% tariff on Chinese goods will put hundreds, if not thousands, of companies and ultimately jobs at risk. "Very few firms have the pricing power to absorb the tariffs or raise prices to offset the impact," Baer said. "Ultimately, the consumer pays."\n\nWhite House officials told CNBC the 55% tariff mentioned in Trump\'s social media post comes from the stacking of the Chinese tariffs. This is the minimum rate being paid by U.S. shippers.\n\nU.S. importers told CNBC the rate is still way too high to resume full orders.\n\n"A 55% tariff from China will substantially cause instability for consumer goods companies that are bringing goods in from China," said Bruce Kaminstein, a member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella. "President Trump recently said he doesn\'t want to make T-shirts. Why is he doing this then? Does he want to make spatulas? I don\'t think so."\n\nThe latest national inflation data released Wednesday showed a smaller-than-expected increase in prices, though volatility is expected with uncertainty about tariff policies remaining.\n\nKaminstein said most companies are working on a 40%-60% gross margin, which will cause either substantial price increases or substantial cutting of expenses to survive, adding stress to the cash flow of these companies.\n\n"A reported 55% tariff on our largest supplier of American apparel and footwear, stacked on top of already high MFN and Section 301 rates is not a win for America," said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "We\'re closely watching for more details, but the reality is this: Nearly all clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are now subject to elevated tariff rates. These costs will hit American families hard, especially as they get ready for back-to-school shopping and the holiday season. New trade deals that bring lower tariffs can\'t come soon enough."\n\nThe Chinese government has not confirmed the Trump statements beyond saying Tuesday it had agreed to the "Geneva consensus" trade terms worked out earlier this year with the U.S. Trump said in a social media post Wednesday about the deal that it is "subject to final approval" of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent floated the idea of extending trade tariff pauses with countries negotiating in good faith.\n\nThe tariff uncertainty is also weighing on EU exports bound for the U.S. Lutnick said Wednesday that an EU trade deal would likely come last, partially due to the need to deal with a bloc of countries rather than a single government.\n\nConsumer demand, recession fears continue during tariff pauses\n\nFreight carriers focused on trade between the U.S. and the EU said they are concerned.\n\nAndrew Abbott, CEO of Atlantic Container Lines, a niche ocean carrier on the Europe/US trade lane, told CNBC the pace of exports and imports has been good, but he is worried a major correction is coming because of the tariff uncertainty and lingering fears of a recession.\n\n"The transatlantic trade has seen an increase in cargo volume in both directions during the last month, averaging 15% compared to last year," Abbott said. "An increasing number of our U.S. import customers are expressing fears of reduced sales because of a potential U.S. recession in the second half, so this is weighing heavy on people\'s minds."\n\nAs a result, Abbott said, many companies are choosing the "wait and see" strategy ahead of any deal being made.\n\nThe trade headlines and concerns come ahead of an expected increase in orders in July and August, peak season for containers to arrive for the holiday shopping season. But logistics experts say there will be no Covid-level surges at U.S. ports.\n\n"Companies pulled in freight to get out of the tariff crosshairs in March, April and May," said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight & Analytics. "Warehouse distribution surged at that time. We are essentially in peak season now."\n\nThe first customers to take advantage of the tariff pause window were those with time-sensitive cargo, such as medical supplies, and high-value cargo, such as automotive parts, luxury furniture, and fashion, according to Mike Short, president of global forwarding for CH Robinson.\n\nNoah Hoffman, vice president for retail logistics for C.H. Robinson, told CNBC that when he was visiting one of its biggest retail customers last week, "I was only sort of surprised to see jack-o\'-lantern dinner plates in their distribution center already."\n\n"We\'re four months out and already moving Halloween items to be ready for store delivery the next day," Hoffman said. "We\'re seeing the same thing in our retail consolidation centers, where we\'re pulling in seasonal and holiday freight from multiple retail suppliers."\n\n"This is a combination of carryover inventory from last year and freight front-loaded in Q1 to avoid the higher tariffs that were coming in April," he said.\n\n\'Damage is done\' in trucking\n\nAfter the U.S. agreed to a pause in the trade war with China, plans were made for shipping that will result in "a busy four-week period this summer," Croke said. But "trucking carriers are worried about the rest of the year," he added. "The second quarter is normally an important setup quarter for the rest of the year, which drives rates up. This means as of now, they are worried they will play catch-up for the rest of the year."\n\nIn the current tariff pause window, there is still time to bring merchandise in from China before the 90-day window closes in mid-August, Hoffman said. "Domestically, we might be moving some of that freight in late June and into July. So, shoppers may have fewer back-to-school items to choose from, but at this point, glow-in-the-dark skeletons and fake vampire teeth will probably make it," he said.\n\nThe trucking industry, in particular, is facing a variety of challenges. While imports contribute approximately 10% of trucking demand, domestic manufacturing is traditionally the main driver, but demand is down. Produce season, another industry driver, is adding to headwinds due to colder spring temperatures in California and decreased consumer demand.\n\n"I think the damage is done this year," Croke said. "Carriers will struggle to recover this year. The supply chain will not recover until these trade deals are done. When you lose trust, how do you make business decisions when it can be undone in a tweet? You have to expect the worst-case scenario, and anything better than that is an upside. I don\'t see how the market recovers."\n\nThe trickle-down impact of the lower freight volumes can be seen in intermodal volume, down 7.42% year over year, and truckload volume, down 13.37% year over year. Both the rail and trucking industries make their profits in moving containers.\n\nThe Ocean TEU Index, which represents the volume of ocean container bookings, shows 2025 is trailing 2024 slightly year over year. Historically, cargo volume has been an early U.S. consumer demand prediction tool.\n\nThe National Retail Federation\'s forecast, based on orders and container analysis for June through October\'s holiday shipping season, is down 14% year over year. Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the NRF, said once a deal is signed, the tariff rate on China will be critical for business decisions.\n\n"We look forward to getting more information from the administration," Gold said. "However, agreeing to a 55% tariff that maintains the current IEEPA, fentanyl, and Section 301 tariffs is still extremely high, particularly for small businesses that continue to struggle with the current tariffs."\n\nManufacturing out of Asia fell to a 17-month low, according to the latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index, a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories and backlogs, based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses.\n\nAnother leading indicator warning of a decrease in manufacturing orders and leaner holiday inventories is empty ocean freight containers.\n\nITS Logistics\' June U.S. Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index showed that empty container return issues persisted at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation\'s busiest. "Empty container buildup continues despite higher outbound empties; congestion challenges remain," the report said.\n\nCH Robinson said it expects softer conditions to persist at the ports of LA and Long Beach, with volume to rise month over month in early June but remain lower than this time last year.\n\nAccording to North American port data analysis from ITS Logistics, the terminals that process the containers at ports nationally are running at 60%-75% capacity.\n\nThe U.S. export market will also continue to experience challenging conditions due to limited vessels after a pullback in sailings by ocean freight companies.\n\nAt the Port of New York, a surplus of empty containers is a result of New York port terminals restricting returns and limiting some export bookings to free up vessel space and improve flow. "Ongoing blank sailings have hindered carriers\' ability to reposition equipment efficiently," C.H. Robinson said. "With limited vessel calls and mounting backlogs, this imbalance is expected to persist in the weeks ahead."\n\nAt Gulf Coast ports, tariff-related demand shifts and blank sailings significantly reduced the volume of incoming containers. "As a result, exporters should expect tightening container availability, particularly at inland rail ramps and U.S. Gulf Coast ports such as Houston, starting in July or August," C.H. Robinson said.\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic, the transport of empty containers back to China took precedence over U.S. exports. Manufacturers in China and Asia needed those containers so they could fill them with products quickly to keep up with the tremendous U.S. consumer demand.\n\n"With the significant reduction in vessels calling LA/LB due to the tariff activity, we are seeing significant increases in empty container dwell outside of the terminals," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics. "It is getting very difficult to find locations to terminate empties and in addition many ocean carriers are implementing laborious termination policies" not seen since the post- Covid era, he said.\n\nThe UK tariff pause resulted in the restoration of more "normal" volume in that market, Abbott said. The fear of an EU tariff pause ending in July fueled the increased EU shipments as manufacturers stocked shelves a bit more in case a UK-type deal for the EU, and deal on steel and aluminum tariffs, are not agreed to in a way that favors greater trade.\n\nBut the ongoing uncertainty can be seen in the exports of the top countries to the U.S.\n\nDeparted container volumes \u2014 20-foot equivalent units \u2014 show Italy is down 15% year over year. China is down 11% year over year, while South Korea is down 9%. Vietnam and India, both beneficiaries of the China-plus-one supply chain strategy, are up 21% and 13%, respectively.\n\nFactoring in the travel time and the trade pause deadlines, U.S. importers only have one more week to place ocean freight orders from the EU to have their products arrive in the U.S. before the tariff pause deadline.\n\nOrders from China need to be placed by the end of June to beat out the existing tariff pause deadline.',

    text: 'Amazon\'s experiment with delivery robots might have a science-fiction feel, but the potential cost savings for the e-commerce giant would be anything but fantasy. Morgan Stanley estimated the e-commerce and cloud giant is now investing to automate roughly $200 billion in logistics costs \u2014 a sum equal to 35% of its online retail revenue \u2014 which includes using AI-powered humanoid robots to make deliveries. The new robots, according to a report in The Information , would go directly to customers\' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs for the billions of packages Amazon ships annually. The company is reportedly testing these AI-powered humanoid robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. Amazon\'s reported work on software to use human-like robots in package delivery represents the next chapter in the company\'s lucrative automation strategy, the analysts said in a note to clients late Thursday. The firm views humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of "more durable market share gains" in Amazon\'s logistics network, which already holds a 30% share of the U.S. parcel delivery market, surpassing UPS and FedEx . Morgan Stanley projects that 10% of U.S. units that go through robotics-enabled warehouses can lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030. While acknowledging the potential for the deployment of humanoids is further out, the analysts highlighted Amazon as "one of the companies best positioned to deliver material financial return from physical AI robots within the next 3-5 years." They also see Amazon\'s retail business as the "most underappreciated" beneficiary of generative AI in the tech industry, with the potential to deliver "more items to more people faster \u2026 and in a more cash flow generative manner" over the next five to 10 years. Shares of the e-commerce giant were up as much as 2% Friday at roughly $212 per share. The stock is down 3.7% year to date. AMZN 1Y mountain Amazon 1-year return Amazon\'s track record supports this optimism. In 2024, the company lowered its global "cost to serve" per unit for the second consecutive year, building on its success in 2023 when it cut costs by over 45 cents per unit. This continued efficiency drove a 61% year-over-year increase in worldwide operating income, reaching a record $21.2 billion last year. The company was able to achieve this by regionalizing its fulfillment network, which shortened delivery distances and enabled it to deliver over 9 billion items to Prime members globally in 2024 with same-day or next day delivery, a company record. Amazon has also been getting help from robots to stow items in warehouses, a task previously done by humans, and leverages machine learning to optimize inventory placement and demand forecasting. As Amazon continues to innovate, investors like us also see a clear path to enhanced profitability and market dominance in logistics given its unmatched scale and disciplined focus on reducing costs through automation. We currently have a buy-equivalent 1 rating on Amazon and a price target of $240 on the stock. (Jim Cramer\'s Charitable Trust is long AMZN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

    text: 'Returns on Amazon are free and easy for shoppers, but they\'re risky and expensive for the small businesses that sell a majority of the goods on the world\'s biggest e-commerce site. Returns have driven some sellers to exit the popular Fulfillment by Amazon program, while others told CNBC they\'d like to leave the platform altogether.\n\nAt the heart of the problem is a big rise in returns fraud, which has led to customers mistakenly receiving used products when they ordered something new. In two particularly egregious examples involving baby products described to CNBC, Amazon sent customers used diapers and a chiller with someone else\'s rotten breastmilk inside.\n\n"I really don\'t think that consumers understand how many small businesses are on Amazon and how their return habits affect small businesses and families like mine," said Rachelle Baron, owner of Beau and Belle Littles, which sells reusable swim diapers on Amazon.\n\nBaron said her business tanked after a return incident with Amazon. The e-commerce platform shipped soiled swim diapers to customers after the used baby products had been returned to Amazon, Baron said.\n\n"There was actually two diapers that were sent out that were poopy," she said.\n\nIn 2024, nearly 14% of all U.S. retail returns were fraudulent, up from 5% in 2018, according to a report by the National Retail Federation. In total, the report found that returns cost retailers $890 billion in 2024.\n\nAmazon started charging sellers in its fulfillment program (FBA) a new fee in June 2024 for items that exceed certain return rate thresholds. Sellers who sign up for FBA rely on Amazon for logistics, including shipping, packing and returns.\n\nIn September, a couple months after the fee went into effect, e-commerce group Helium 10 saw return rates for U.S. Amazon sellers drop nearly 5%.\n\n"It\'s forcing the seller to have higher quality listings and higher quality products," said Helium 10 General Manager Zoe Lu.\n\nAmazon has also started adding a warning label to some "frequently returned items," which could be contributing to the dip.\n\nRising prices\n\nHowever, the new fee may also be leading to rising prices.\n\nOne survey by e-commerce analysis company SmartScout found that 65% of sellers said they raised prices in 2024 directly because of Amazon fee changes. Other sellers told CNBC returns fraud is the reason they\'ve raised prices.\n\nIn total, CNBC talked to seven Amazon sellers to find out how they\'re handling the rising cost of returns.\n\n"We\'re running at about just over 1% net profit on Amazon, totally due to fraud and return abuse," said Lorie Corlett, who sells Sterling Spectrum protective cases for hot wheels. She said her return rate is 4% on Amazon and only 1% on other marketplaces like Walmart . "It\'s really Amazon that\'s accountable at the end of the day. People would stop doing it if Amazon held them accountable."\n\nAmazon told CNBC it has no tolerance for fraudulent returns and that it takes action against some scammers. Those measures include denying refunds and requiring customer identity verification.\n\nMike Jelliff sells professional music gear through his GeekStands brand on Amazon and eight other marketplaces. He said his return rate on Amazon is three times higher than the average he sees elsewhere.\n\n"On eBay , we\'re allowed to block specific customers out," Jelliff said. "But on Amazon, that customer is still allowed to repurchase from us."\n\nJelliff showed CNBC the system of about 40 cameras he\'s installed in his Tyler, Texas, warehouse to track every outgoing item, incoming return and unboxing. He uses the images when filing appeals with Amazon, including when customers request refunds claiming they never receive an item. He keeps a blacklist of repeat offenders who commit this kind of fraud and those who return used and damaged items, which become a total loss for him.\n\nAmazon has made some improvements to its returns process, said Jelliff, who doesn\'t rely on FBA. This includes Amazon allowing small businesses to make multiple appeals when fighting a fraudulent return. Amazon has also let Jelliff opt-out of automatic return labels for items above $100 starting in 2023, and his return rate has been dropping since.\n\nJacob Schatz\n\nWhy returns are destroyed\n\nFiguring out which returns are fraudulent and which are ready for re-sale is labor-intensive and item specific, experts said. That creates plenty of room for error.\n\n"Because it\'s such a large operation, things are missed," said Lu of Helium 10. "I think they\'re probably missed on the margins, but these stories are very impactful because it is such a reckoning for the brand."\n\nCeres Chill founder Lisa Myers, who once relied on Amazon to handle returns for her business as part of FBA, has one of these stories.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon sent one of Ceres Chill\'s products to a customer with someone else\'s rotten breastmilk inside, said Myers, adding that the customer wrote a review saying, "she will never forget that smell."\n\n"To have something, and I don\'t mean to be dramatic, but dangerous, somebody else\'s bodily fluids in your kitchen rotting in something that you had intended to use for your child is unacceptable," Myers said. "That\'s the moment I broke down crying and just sat down and thought, I have no idea how this could have happened."\n\nMyers said she left FBA after the incident, leaving behind benefits like having her products labeled with Amazon\'s Prime badge.\n\n"It hurts our business to not participate in Fulfilled by Amazon," Myers said. "It\'s just we\'re not willing to, we will never put profit over the safety and, frankly, mental health of our customers."\n\nInstead, Myers outsources all her returns to baby resell specialist Goodbuy Gear, which is on track to re-sell 200,000 returned baby products this year.\n\nRe-selling responsibly\n\nKristin Langenfeld started GoodBuy Gear when she was a new mom struggling to find a good quality, used jogging stroller.\n\n"We\'ve spent the last nine years building out a database that has all of the products and the variations, the common issues, the recalls," Langenfeld said. "For some of these, there\'s 40 points that we inspect on the item itself, and it\'s really complicated."\n\nLangenfeld showed CNBC the process at her warehouse in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where each item is inspected for about 15 minutes and is typically handled by at least four employees. The resource intensive process is paying off. She says 33 new sellers signed up in 2024, three times more than the previous year. And with business growing 50% year-over-year, she\'s upgrading to a bigger warehouse in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nShe was inspired to handle returns after visiting a major retailer\'s returns warehouse five years ago.\n\n"Taped on the floor were signs that said \'incinerate,\' \'destroy,\'" she said.\n\nReturns generated an estimated 29 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2024, and 9.8 billion pounds of returns ended up in landfills, according to reverse logistics software provider Optoro.\n\nAmazon has faced criticism for destroying millions of pounds of unused products. In 2022, Amazon told CNBC it was "working towards a goal of zero product disposal," but wouldn\'t give a timeline for that ambition. Three years later, that goal is still in the works, with Amazon telling CNBC in a statement, "The vast majority of returns are resold as new or used, returned to selling partners, liquidated, or donated."\n\nIn 2020, Amazon added two new options for sellers to re-home returns. "Grade and Resell" allows all U.S. FBA sellers to have Amazon rate the return and mark it as "used" before re-selling it. FBA Liquidation allows sellers to recoup some losses by offloading palettes of goods for re-sale on the secondary market through liquidation partners like Liquidity Services.\n\nThere\'s also an FBA Donations program that\'s been around since 2019, allowing sellers to automatically offer eligible overstock and returns to charity groups through the non-profit Good360. Amazon told CNBC these seller programs give a second life to more than 300 million items a year.\n\nFor shoppers wanting to keep returns from incineration or landfills, Amazon also has options.\n\nAmazon Resale has used and open-box goods, Amazon Renewed sells refurbished items and Amazon Outlet sells overstock. Daily deal site Woot!, bought by Amazon for $110 million in 2010, also sells scratched and dented items. Customers can also trade in certain electronics, like Amazon devices, phones and tablets, for Amazon gift cards or send them to the company\'s certified recycler.\n\n"I hope the change that we\'re able to make as a country is that we stop making crap," Langenfeld said. "We should make high quality products that are meant for resale."',

    text: 'Stefani Reynolds | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe closure of a trade loophole and prohibitive tariffs on China have upended Temu and Shein\'s business model in the United States. And yet the e-commerce companies are likely to remain a dominant force in American online retailing, experts suggest.\n\nOn Friday, the de minimis rule \u2014 a policy that had exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs \u2014 officially closed for shipments from China. This has seen Temu and Shein exposed to duties as high as 120% or a flat fee of $100, set to rise to $200 in June.\n\nThe small-package tariff exemption had been key to the companies\' ability to maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped from China. In the lead-up to its removal, prices of goods shipped directly from China on Temu and Shein surged, with Temu later ending direct shipments from outside the U.S. altogether.\n\nThe change will be welcomed by many detractors of de minimis, among them U.S. lawmakers, labor unions and retailers, who have argued that Temu and Shein abused the exemption to undercut local businesses and flood the country with illicit and counterfeit products.\n\nBut despite the new trade challenges that Temu and Shein face, e-commerce and supply chain experts told CNBC that the companies are still capable of competing with their rivals in the U.S.\n\n"Don\'t count them out ... Not at all. These kinds of Chinese e-commerce apps are very adept and agile. They have contingency plans in place and have taken the necessary steps to cover the tariffs from a margin perspective," said Deborah Weinswig, CEO and founder of Coresight Research.\n\n"I personally believe, if anything, [America\'s e-commerce] game has been accelerating in favor of Temu and Shein ... I wouldn\'t be surprised if the competitiveness gap actually continues to widen," added Weinswig, whose research and advisory firm works with clients across tech, retail and supply chains.\n\nContingencies in place\n\nThe loss of the de minimis exemption had long been anticipated, with U.S. President Donald Trump temporarily closing it in February. In preparation, Temu and Shein had been accelerating localization strategies for the U.S.\n\nScott Miller, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm pdPlus, told CNBC that Shein and Temu will continue to onboard goods from American sellers onto their apps to protect them from tariffs.\n\n"Many of the current sellers on Temu and Shein are located in China or countries nearby, but not all. Local U.S. companies have been joining these platforms at an accelerating pace ... several of our clients have onboarded or began the process of onboarding in just the past few months," he said.\n\nWhile margins for more localized brands and sellers will be lower on the platforms than those shipping directly from China, they can be competitive, according to Miller.\n\nHe added that in the case of Temu, vendors are attracted to lower fees, lighter competition and greater assistance with onboarding and setting up sales channels compared with what Amazon offers.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn recent days, Temu, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has begun exclusively offering goods shipped from local warehouses to U.S. shoppers.\n\nMany of those goods are still sourced from China but then shipped in bulk to U.S. warehouses, according to experts. While these bulk items are subject to tariffs, they also benefit from economies of scale.\n\nThis development is likely to see the variety of products on Temu scaled back, said Henry Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University. However, he added, Temu is likely to resume direct shipments from China, depending on the outcome of the trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nShein, meanwhile, has leaned into supply chain expansion, building manufacturing operations in countries such as Turkey, Mexico and Brazil, and reportedly plans to shift to Vietnam.\n\nThe company appears to still be shipping directly from China and likely has more room to absorb tariffs because of its "sky-high" margins in its core fast-fashion business, Jin said.\n\n"If there\'s one thing that Chinese companies are good at, it\'s operating on a razor thin margin in an intensely competitive, if not adverse environment ... they find every scrap that they can to survive," he added.\n\nCompetitive prices?\n\nContingency plans aside, experts said that Trump\'s trade policy will likely continue to fuel higher prices for goods on Temu and Shein\'s apps.\n\nPrices across different shopping categories on Shein rose between 5% and 50% in the latter half of April, with the sharpest rises seen in toys and games and beauty and health, according to data from Coresight.\n\nRegardless, many e-commerce experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will continue to prove price-competitive.\n\nTemu, which had increased prices of orders shipped directly from China, told CNBC on Tuesday that "pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model."\n\nCoresight\'s Weinswig said the two companies have previously been able to offer products at a third of the prices on Amazon for comparable goods. So, even if they more than double the prices to absorb the impacts of tariffs, many goods could remain cheaper than those on American e-commerce sites and retailers.\n\nJason Wong, who works in product logistics for Temu in Hong Kong, noted this dynamic when speaking to CNBC last month, likening Temu to a dollar store. If prices at the dollar store go from $1 to $2, it\'s still a dollar store, he said.\n\nFurthermore, Trump\'s trade tariffs on China and other trade partners have also affected American retailers and e-commerce sites like Amazon.\n\nOther advantages\n\nWhen Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, it blamed Shein and Temu\'s use of the de minimis exemption, which it said "undercut" its business.\n\nBut experts say that exclusively attributing the success of Shein and Temu to that trade loophole misses many of the other factors that have made them smash hits in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, Temu and Shein owe a lot of their success to their very agile supply chains that adapt fast to consumer trends.\n\nFor example, Shein\'s small-batch production \u2014 in which product styles are initially launched in limited quantities, typically around 100-200 items \u2014 allows it to test and scale products efficiently.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnother key is the companies\' applications, which use various strategies to maintain user interest, including frequent phone notifications, product recommendation algorithms and perhaps most notably, constantly displaying discounted prices from promotions and flash sales.\n\nTemu was offering a "mega savings extravaganza" for American consumers on Monday. Some of the bestselling items on sale included stainless steel hook earrings for $1.45 and a fitted mattress pad for $11.54. It\'s unclear if the discounted local goods were stockpiled before tariffs came into effect.\n\nIn addition, app users will often be met with mini-games that grant different coupons or ways to earn rewards, as well as opportunities to buy "mystery boxes" with assorted products.\n\nThat "gamification strategy" definitely plays into the consumer psychology of many U.S. shoppers who often buy items out of the excitement of being able to get a great deal, said Miami University\'s Jin.\n\nExperts also flagged that Temu and Shein have been very effective at marketing, including through the harnessing of livestreaming and social media.\n\nOn the other hand, according to Coresights\' Weinswig, American retailers have failed to adequately recognize threats from Temu and Shein and adjust their supply chains and pricing models.',

It scooped up Pitney Bowes' e-commerce fulfillment business and freight and logistics platform ProPack in 2024.\n\nStord's backers include Kleiner Perkins, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Franklin Templeton and Strike Capital.\n\nHenry started Stord as an 18-year-old and dropped out of the Georgia Institute of Technology after winning a spot in the exclusive Thiel Fellowship that offers grants to aspiring entrepreneurs. He said Thiel's lessons on building a defensible competitive advantage helped drive Stord's value proposition.\n\n\"If we are the one who's building our own technology in harmony with our operations, from every stage all the way through the cart \u2026 it's gonna be really hard for others to keep up,\" he told CNBC.",

    text: "China's latest shopping festival, which wrapped up Wednesday, pointed to a pickup in consumption, as e-commerce companies reported strong sales of consumer electronics, as well as beauty and pet care products.\n\nThe 618 festival is one of the biggest promotional periods of the year in China as Alibaba , JD.com and other major Chinese e-commerce platforms roll out discounts.\n\nThis year, the festival's gross merchandise value, a measure of sales over time, surged by 15.2% from last year to an estimated to 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun.\n\nThat points to some recovery in consumption, after Syntun data for last year's 618 festival revealed a year-on-year decline in sales for the first time in eight years. However, as has been the case with other annual shopping events, retailers expanded the promotional period to start May 13, a week earlier than in 2024, before ending June 18.\n\nStill, JD.com said the number of shoppers participating hit a record high, more than doubling year on year between May 30 and June 18 to an unspecified figure. More than 2.2 billion orders were recorded across JD's channels, which include online and offline stores, food delivery and quick commerce, according to the retailer.\n\nInvestors were surprised Monday by a better-than-expected 6.4% increase in national retail sales in May from a year ago \u2014 the fastest increase since December 2023, according to official data accessed via Wind Information.\n\nChinese consumers are spending \"a lot of money on outerwear. Cosmetics and beauty doing really well,\" Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, told CNBC on Friday. The company helps foreign brands \u2014 such as Vitamix and iS Clinical \u2014 sell online in China and other parts of Asia.\n\nHis firm estimates that gross merchandise value during 618 grew by around 14.1% from a year ago, pointing to a slightly slower increase than what Syntun reported.\n\nHe also pointed to growing numbers of customers outside of China's big, well-known cities, based on the packages he's seen leaving his company's warehouse.\n\nBeijing's trade-in program to subsidize certain consumer products such as consumer electronics helped boost sales.\n\nHousehold appliances emerged champion among the categories, bringing in 110.1 billion yuan in sales, while beauty and skin care products clocked in 43.2 billion yuan in sales, according to Syntun.\n\nSimilarly, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba 's Taobao and Tmall reported strong sales in categories eligible for government subsidies \u2014 with initial sales more than tripling from the same period around the Nov. 11 Singles' Day shopping festival, indicating increased consumer interest in the newest batch of subsidies.\n\nTaobao's generative artificial intelligence tools also boosted sales. Its image-to-video feature and an advanced marketing bidding model boosted campaign return on investment by an average of 12%, the company said earlier this month. That echoes how Alibaba and other major Chinese companies reported improved first-quarter consumer sales, bolstered in part by AI-powered marketing tools.\n\nShoppers are also splurging on their pets. Taobao and Tmall noted a surge in demand for pet care products, as total sales in the first 100 minutes surpassed the total sales from the first four hours of the same period last year.\n\nThis year's 618 festival lasted over a month, running from May 13 to June 18. While retail sales have improved in that period, experts warn that the prolonged duration of such festivals could reduce the incentive for consumption.\n\n\"If you do have these festivals, and that's becoming more regular feature of these online platforms that these discounts, rebates and special offers, they continue all throughout the year in different guises, then it becomes difficult for the average consumer to keep on participating in them,\" said Manishi Raychaudhuri, CEO of Emmer Capital Partners, on CNBC's \"The China Connection\" on Friday.\n\nInstead, the government and companies will have to think of more innovative ways to boost domestic consumption, he added.\n\nBeijing has opted not to hand out cash to consumers, instead focusing on subsidies for specific products and incremental measures to support employment.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",

    text: 'The global economy may be facing an uncertain 2025 in light of trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts, but there\'s a bright spot that investors can take solace in: aviation.\n\nThe profitability of the aviation industry is expected to improve in 2025, despite global gross domestic product growth being forecast to drop to 2.5% in 2025 from 3.3% in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nIn a report released on Monday, the IATA said revenue, operating profits and net profits of the industry are expected to increase from 2024, although some of those were lower than projections made in December.\n\nFor example, net profits for the industry are projected at $36 billion for 2025, up from the $32.4 billion earned in 2024, but slightly lower than the December projection of $36.6 billion.\n\nThe aviation industry\'s net profit margin is also forecast to rise to 3.7% in 2025, from 3.4% the previous year.\n\nTotal revenues are projected to hit a record high of $979 billion, 1.3% higher than the previous year, but down from the $1 trillion in its last forecast.\n\nThe IATA attributed the better results mainly to two factors: lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency.\n\nIt expects passenger load factors will reach an all-time high in 2025 with a full-year average of 84%, "as fleet expansion and modernization remains challenging amid supply chain failures in the aerospace sector." PLF shows how efficiently an airline is filling its seats.\n\nJet fuel costs are expected to average $86 per barrel in 2025, down from $99 in 2024, the IATA noted, saying it will translate into a total fuel bill of $236 billion, $25 billion lower than the $261 billion incurred in 2024.\n\n"Recent financial data show minimal fuel hedging activity over the past year, indicating that airlines will generally benefit from the reduced fuel cost. It is not expected that fuel will be impacted by trade tensions," IATA said.\n\nNorth America is expected to generate the highest absolute profit among all regions in 2025, and the Asia-Pacific region is set to see the largest demand growth in 2025, with revenue per passenger kilometer projected to grow 9% year on year, the IATA said.\n\nRevenue passenger kilometers, or RPK, is a measure of the volume of passengers carried by an airline. The metric is used to assess airline performance and passenger demand.\n\nThe IATA said that "if an airline sees a consistent increase in RPKs on a particular route over several months, this might prompt the carrier to increase flight frequency or deploy larger aircraft to meet growing demand \u2014 potentially boosting revenue and market share."\n\nIt attributed strong passenger demand in the Asia-Pacific to the relaxation of visa requirements in several Asian countries, especially China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nThe IATA did note, however, that the economic landscape poses some challenges, with the GDP forecast for the region, particularly China, having been lowered.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect the correct title of Adrian Neuhauser.',

    text: 'Feature China | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nIf China is going to lose some manufacturing as a result of President Donald Trump\'s tariffs, the U.S. manufacturing sector won\'t be the main beneficiary, according to a new CNBC Supply Chain Survey.\n\nThe Trump administration says a reshoring boom is coming, but most companies that responded to the survey told CNBC that bringing back supply chains could as much as double their costs and that instead a search for low-tariff regimes around the world will commence.\n\nOver half of those surveyed (57%) said cost is the biggest headwind in relocating supply chains to the U.S.; 21% said the top challenge is finding skilled labor. The Trump administration has promised tax cuts for companies that bring back manufacturing, but the survey found that only 14% of respondents chose taxes as the biggest challenge in deciding whether to relocate manufacturing to the U.S.\n\nDespite some recent high-profile announcements from the tech sector, including Nvidia\'s plans for a supercomputer plant in the U.S. and Apple\'s commitment to invest $500 billion in the country, most companies cite costs as prohibitive. The Trump administration gave the tech sector a reprieve Friday from new tariffs on China and other global manufacturing nations, but the White House is moving ahead with a national security investigation that targets critical technology for future tariffs.\n\nTaken together, the majority of respondents estimated that the price tag of building a new domestic supply chain would be around double (18%) or more than double (47%) current costs. Instead of moving supply chains back to the United States, it would be more cost-effective to relocate them to lower-tariffed countries, according to 61% of respondents.\n\nConsumer demand, raw material prices, and the "current administration\'s inability to provide a consistent strategy" were cited as key supply chain concerns, in addition to the tariffs.\n\nA majority of respondents (61%) who answered a question about whether they feel the Trump administration "is bullying corporate America" answered "Yes."\n\nwatch now\n\nA total of 380 respondents from companies in the supply chain and business organizations were included in the survey, conducted from April 7-10, with 120 respondents answering every question. The survey was sent to members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, National Retail Federation, American Apparel and Footwear Association, Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, OL USA, SEKO Logistics, and ITS Logistics.\n\nAmong respondents indicating interest in reestablishing a U.S. supply chain, 41% said it would take three to five years, and 33% said it would take longer than five years.\n\nAutomation would dominate\n\nIf manufacturing is coming back to the U.S., automation will be a major component of the economic model, with 81% of respondents saying they would use it more than they would human workers.\n\n"The U.S. labor market is a concern when considering movement back to the U.S.," said Mark Baxa, CEO of supply chain trade group CSCMP.\n\nIn the current environment, layoffs are an immediate concern, with respondents almost evenly split between those who said they are planning head count reductions (47%) and those who say they do not have current layoff plans (53%). To a more general question of how long firms will "wait to make staffing decisions" the majority said no longer than nine months \u2014 38% indicated within two to three months; 23% over the next three to six months.\n\nA Fed survey released Monday found a surge in fears about layoffs.\n\nRight now, the most widespread reaction to the Trump tariffs is the cancellation of orders, according to 89% of respondents, and an expectation that consumers will pull back on spending, which 75% of respondents said they are forecasting. For products that are coming in under the new tariff rates, 61% of those who participated in the survey said they would raise prices.\n\nwatch now\n\n"The immediate impact is order cancellations and the risk of consumer spending pullback is noteworthy," Baxa said.\n\nSurvey respondents expect the hardest-hit products as a result of a pullback in consumer spending to be discretionary products (44%), furniture (19%) and luxury (19%).\n\n"As of now, we have seen a heavy cancellation or pause rate for freight originating from China, but are seeing increased volumes and front loading from other countries in Asia that had their reciprocal tariffs paused for 90 days," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics.\n\nRecession warning from supply chain\n\nSixty-three percent of respondents warn of a recession affecting the U.S. economy this year as a result of Trump\'s tariffs policy, with roughly half (51%) expecting a consumer pullback to hit in Q2.\n\n"Supply chains that support millions of U.S. jobs, power U.S. manufacturers, and provide affordable choices for U.S. consumers are now experiencing early signs of damage due to these destructive tariffs," said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. "Higher prices, job losses, product shortages, and bankruptcies will be only some of the adversity the U.S. economy weathers while the President pursues this ill-advised tariff policy."\n\nHe previously told CNBC that the damage to businesses across the economy may soon be "irreversible."\n\nTrump\'s National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, said Monday that more than 10 countries have made "amazing" trade deal offers to the United States and he "100%" guaranteed there is no recession coming.\n\nMultiple surveys taking the pulse of CEOs show widespread expectations that a recession may have already started or is soon to come.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that based on conversations he has had with CEOs across the economy, the U.S. is either very close to or already in a recession now.\n\nSmaller businesses and startups say the tariffs will be catastrophic and place U.S. jobs at risk.\n\n"Small consumer companies that started with an innovative idea do not have the capital to invest in building factories," said Bruce Kaminstein, a member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella.

    text: 'U.S. President Donald Trump\'s tariff pause gives Temu and Shein a temporary window of opportunity to restock U.S.-based warehouses and re-evaluate their supply chain management, experts and insiders say.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. and China agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days. The agreement included a so-called "de minimis" rule relaxation, effective May 14, which will see low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China now be taxed at a tariff rate of 54%, down from 120% prior.\n\nPrevious tariff rates had driven price hikes for U.S. consumers on Shein\'s platforms. Meanwhile, Temu halted shipments directly from China altogether, leading to some disruptions in fulfilling its U.S. orders.\n\nBut the recent tariff cut has given them a chance to ramp up shipments from China and restock their warehouses and fulfill existing orders, supply chain experts say.\n\n"In the short term, [Temu and Shein] are definitely going to increase their shipment volume to the U.S.," said Anand Kumar, associate director of research at Coresight Research, adding that it will also help the companies reassess their long-term strategy.\n\nAccording to Jason Wong, who has been associated with Temu\'s product logistics and operation in Hong Kong, the company has paused shipments from China after the end of the "de minimis" exemption and relied on U.S. stockpiles to fulfil orders.\n\nUnder the latest tariff policy, Wong anticipates that bulk shipments subject to the 30% tariff rate will resume to the U.S., replenishing these stockpiles.\n\n"[The] 30% is still high, but compared to 125%, 30% is basically nothing," he added.\n\nThe latest policy update retains a $100 flat fee per postal item, while scrapping a previously planned hike to $200 starting June, according to an executive order released by the White House on Monday.\n\nAccording to Wong, for Temu to resume its small value shipments from China to the U.S., the tariffs still need to be relaxed further \u2014 something he expects will happen eventually.\n\nShein has not said that it is ending direct shipments from China. However, it says on its platform that "tariffs are included in the price you pay."\n\nThe reduction on tariffs of low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China could therefore result in the easing of some prices, said Coresight\'s Kumar.\n\nIn anticipation of changes to the "de minimis" exemption, Shein has also expanded its supply chains, building manufacturing operations in countries such as Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. It also reportedly plans to shift production to Vietnam.\n\nShein and Temu did not immediately respond to CNBC\'s request for comments.\n\nOn May 2, Trump ended the "de minimis" exemption policy, which analysts had criticized as hurting local businesses and disguising illicit fentanyl trade.\n\nThe small-package tariff exemption had helped Temu and Shein maintain budget prices on the merchandise they shipped directly from China.\n\nThe U.S. government had briefly suspended the exemption in February before reinstating the provision days later, as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a spate of low-value packages.\n\nU.S. rivals like Amazon, on whose platform many third-party sellers offload products sourced or assembled by Chinese manufacturers, are also expected to ramp up shipments during the 90-day window, trade experts said.\n\n"All the companies are just going to scramble to get everything they can into the country as quickly as they can," said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consultancy firm Tidalwave Solution. "Everybody\'s in the same boat."',

    text: 'Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared the trade war with China "done" Wednesday, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Chinese goods will be locked in at the current 55% rate without additional increases. Even if the resolution to the battle with the biggest U.S. foe in Trump\'s trade war is real, the damage to the supply chain, the U.S. consumer and the economy will remain, say logistics and retail industry executives.\n\nThe latest headlines in the trade war come amid a slowdown in orders as the early 2025 period of tariff front-loading ended and firms across the economy prepared for a potential slowdown in the U.S.\n\n"I think there\'s a chance real numbers will deteriorate soon," Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, the nation\'s largest bank, said at a Morgan Stanley event Tuesday, before the Trump administration\'s most recent comments.\n\nAlan Baer, CEO of logistics firm OL USA, said the existing 55% tariff on Chinese goods will put hundreds, if not thousands, of companies and ultimately jobs at risk. "Very few firms have the pricing power to absorb the tariffs or raise prices to offset the impact," Baer said. "Ultimately, the consumer pays."\n\nWhite House officials told CNBC the 55% tariff mentioned in Trump\'s social media post comes from the stacking of the Chinese tariffs. This is the minimum rate being paid by U.S. shippers.\n\nU.S. importers told CNBC the rate is still way too high to resume full orders.\n\n"A 55% tariff from China will substantially cause instability for consumer goods companies that are bringing goods in from China," said Bruce Kaminstein, a member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella. "President Trump recently said he doesn\'t want to make T-shirts. Why is he doing this then? Does he want to make spatulas? I don\'t think so."\n\nThe latest national inflation data released Wednesday showed a smaller-than-expected increase in prices, though volatility is expected with uncertainty about tariff policies remaining.\n\nKaminstein said most companies are working on a 40%-60% gross margin, which will cause either substantial price increases or substantial cutting of expenses to survive, adding stress to the cash flow of these companies.\n\n"A reported 55% tariff on our largest supplier of American apparel and footwear, stacked on top of already high MFN and Section 301 rates is not a win for America," said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "We\'re closely watching for more details, but the reality is this: Nearly all clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are now subject to elevated tariff rates. These costs will hit American families hard, especially as they get ready for back-to-school shopping and the holiday season. New trade deals that bring lower tariffs can\'t come soon enough."\n\nThe Chinese government has not confirmed the Trump statements beyond saying Tuesday it had agreed to the "Geneva consensus" trade terms worked out earlier this year with the U.S. Trump said in a social media post Wednesday about the deal that it is "subject to final approval" of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent floated the idea of extending trade tariff pauses with countries negotiating in good faith.\n\nThe tariff uncertainty is also weighing on EU exports bound for the U.S. Lutnick said Wednesday that an EU trade deal would likely come last, partially due to the need to deal with a bloc of countries rather than a single government.\n\nConsumer demand, recession fears continue during tariff pauses\n\nFreight carriers focused on trade between the U.S. and the EU said they are concerned.\n\nAndrew Abbott, CEO of Atlantic Container Lines, a niche ocean carrier on the Europe/US trade lane, told CNBC the pace of exports and imports has been good, but he is worried a major correction is coming because of the tariff uncertainty and lingering fears of a recession.\n\n"The transatlantic trade has seen an increase in cargo volume in both directions during the last month, averaging 15% compared to last year," Abbott said. "An increasing number of our U.S. import customers are expressing fears of reduced sales because of a potential U.S. recession in the second half, so this is weighing heavy on people\'s minds."\n\nAs a result, Abbott said, many companies are choosing the "wait and see" strategy ahead of any deal being made.\n\nThe trade headlines and concerns come ahead of an expected increase in orders in July and August, peak season for containers to arrive for the holiday shopping season. But logistics experts say there will be no Covid-level surges at U.S. ports.\n\n"Companies pulled in freight to get out of the tariff crosshairs in March, April and May," said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight & Analytics. "Warehouse distribution surged at that time. We are essentially in peak season now."\n\nThe first customers to take advantage of the tariff pause window were those with time-sensitive cargo, such as medical supplies, and high-value cargo, such as automotive parts, luxury furniture, and fashion, according to Mike Short, president of global forwarding for CH Robinson.\n\nNoah Hoffman, vice president for retail logistics for C.H. Robinson, told CNBC that when he was visiting one of its biggest retail customers last week, "I was only sort of surprised to see jack-o\'-lantern dinner plates in their distribution center already."\n\n"We\'re four months out and already moving Halloween items to be ready for store delivery the next day," Hoffman said. "We\'re seeing the same thing in our retail consolidation centers, where we\'re pulling in seasonal and holiday freight from multiple retail suppliers."\n\n"This is a combination of carryover inventory from last year and freight front-loaded in Q1 to avoid the higher tariffs that were coming in April," he said.\n\n\'Damage is done\' in trucking\n\nAfter the U.S. agreed to a pause in the trade war with China, plans were made for shipping that will result in "a busy four-week period this summer," Croke said. But "trucking carriers are worried about the rest of the year," he added. "The second quarter is normally an important setup quarter for the rest of the year, which drives rates up. This means as of now, they are worried they will play catch-up for the rest of the year."\n\nIn the current tariff pause window, there is still time to bring merchandise in from China before the 90-day window closes in mid-August, Hoffman said. "Domestically, we might be moving some of that freight in late June and into July. So, shoppers may have fewer back-to-school items to choose from, but at this point, glow-in-the-dark skeletons and fake vampire teeth will probably make it," he said.\n\nThe trucking industry, in particular, is facing a variety of challenges. While imports contribute approximately 10% of trucking demand, domestic manufacturing is traditionally the main driver, but demand is down. Produce season, another industry driver, is adding to headwinds due to colder spring temperatures in California and decreased consumer demand.\n\n"I think the damage is done this year," Croke said. "Carriers will struggle to recover this year. The supply chain will not recover until these trade deals are done. When you lose trust, how do you make business decisions when it can be undone in a tweet? You have to expect the worst-case scenario, and anything better than that is an upside. I don\'t see how the market recovers."\n\nThe trickle-down impact of the lower freight volumes can be seen in intermodal volume, down 7.42% year over year, and truckload volume, down 13.37% year over year. Both the rail and trucking industries make their profits in moving containers.\n\nThe Ocean TEU Index, which represents the volume of ocean container bookings, shows 2025 is trailing 2024 slightly year over year. Historically, cargo volume has been an early U.S. consumer demand prediction tool.\n\nThe National Retail Federation\'s forecast, based on orders and container analysis for June through October\'s holiday shipping season, is down 14% year over year. Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the NRF, said once a deal is signed, the tariff rate on China will be critical for business decisions.\n\n"We look forward to getting more information from the administration," Gold said. "However, agreeing to a 55% tariff that maintains the current IEEPA, fentanyl, and Section 301 tariffs is still extremely high, particularly for small businesses that continue to struggle with the current tariffs."\n\nManufacturing out of Asia fell to a 17-month low, according to the latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index, a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories and backlogs, based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses.\n\nAnother leading indicator warning of a decrease in manufacturing orders and leaner holiday inventories is empty ocean freight containers.\n\nITS Logistics\' June U.S. Port/Rail Ramp Freight Index showed that empty container return issues persisted at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the nation\'s busiest. "Empty container buildup continues despite higher outbound empties; congestion challenges remain," the report said.\n\nCH Robinson said it expects softer conditions to persist at the ports of LA and Long Beach, with volume to rise month over month in early June but remain lower than this time last year.\n\nAccording to North American port data analysis from ITS Logistics, the terminals that process the containers at ports nationally are running at 60%-75% capacity.\n\nThe U.S. export market will also continue to experience challenging conditions due to limited vessels after a pullback in sailings by ocean freight companies.\n\nAt the Port of New York, a surplus of empty containers is a result of New York port terminals restricting returns and limiting some export bookings to free up vessel space and improve flow. "Ongoing blank sailings have hindered carriers\' ability to reposition equipment efficiently," C.H. Robinson said. "With limited vessel calls and mounting backlogs, this imbalance is expected to persist in the weeks ahead."\n\nAt Gulf Coast ports, tariff-related demand shifts and blank sailings significantly reduced the volume of incoming containers. "As a result, exporters should expect tightening container availability, particularly at inland rail ramps and U.S. Gulf Coast ports such as Houston, starting in July or August," C.H. Robinson said.\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic, the transport of empty containers back to China took precedence over U.S. exports. Manufacturers in China and Asia needed those containers so they could fill them with products quickly to keep up with the tremendous U.S. consumer demand.\n\n"With the significant reduction in vessels calling LA/LB due to the tariff activity, we are seeing significant increases in empty container dwell outside of the terminals," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics. "It is getting very difficult to find locations to terminate empties and in addition many ocean carriers are implementing laborious termination policies" not seen since the post- Covid era, he said.\n\nThe UK tariff pause resulted in the restoration of more "normal" volume in that market, Abbott said. The fear of an EU tariff pause ending in July fueled the increased EU shipments as manufacturers stocked shelves a bit more in case a UK-type deal for the EU, and deal on steel and aluminum tariffs, are not agreed to in a way that favors greater trade.\n\nBut the ongoing uncertainty can be seen in the exports of the top countries to the U.S.\n\nDeparted container volumes \u2014 20-foot equivalent units \u2014 show Italy is down 15% year over year. China is down 11% year over year, while South Korea is down 9%. Vietnam and India, both beneficiaries of the China-plus-one supply chain strategy, are up 21% and 13%, respectively.\n\nFactoring in the travel time and the trade pause deadlines, U.S. importers only have one more week to place ocean freight orders from the EU to have their products arrive in the U.S. before the tariff pause deadline.\n\nOrders from China need to be placed by the end of June to beat out the existing tariff pause deadline.',

    text: 'Amazon\'s experiment with delivery robots might have a science-fiction feel, but the potential cost savings for the e-commerce giant would be anything but fantasy. Morgan Stanley estimated the e-commerce and cloud giant is now investing to automate roughly $200 billion in logistics costs \u2014 a sum equal to 35% of its online retail revenue \u2014 which includes using AI-powered humanoid robots to make deliveries. The new robots, according to a report in The Information , would go directly to customers\' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs for the billions of packages Amazon ships annually. The company is reportedly testing these AI-powered humanoid robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. Amazon\'s reported work on software to use human-like robots in package delivery represents the next chapter in the company\'s lucrative automation strategy, the analysts said in a note to clients late Thursday. The firm views humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of "more durable market share gains" in Amazon\'s logistics network, which already holds a 30% share of the U.S. parcel delivery market, surpassing UPS and FedEx . Morgan Stanley projects that 10% of U.S. units that go through robotics-enabled warehouses can lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030. While acknowledging the potential for the deployment of humanoids is further out, the analysts highlighted Amazon as "one of the companies best positioned to deliver material financial return from physical AI robots within the next 3-5 years." They also see Amazon\'s retail business as the "most underappreciated" beneficiary of generative AI in the tech industry, with the potential to deliver "more items to more people faster \u2026 and in a more cash flow generative manner" over the next five to 10 years. Shares of the e-commerce giant were up as much as 2% Friday at roughly $212 per share. The stock is down 3.7% year to date. AMZN 1Y mountain Amazon 1-year return Amazon\'s track record supports this optimism. In 2024, the company lowered its global "cost to serve" per unit for the second consecutive year, building on its success in 2023 when it cut costs by over 45 cents per unit. This continued efficiency drove a 61% year-over-year increase in worldwide operating income, reaching a record $21.2 billion last year. The company was able to achieve this by regionalizing its fulfillment network, which shortened delivery distances and enabled it to deliver over 9 billion items to Prime members globally in 2024 with same-day or next day delivery, a company record. Amazon has also been getting help from robots to stow items in warehouses, a task previously done by humans, and leverages machine learning to optimize inventory placement and demand forecasting. As Amazon continues to innovate, investors like us also see a clear path to enhanced profitability and market dominance in logistics given its unmatched scale and disciplined focus on reducing costs through automation. We currently have a buy-equivalent 1 rating on Amazon and a price target of $240 on the stock. (Jim Cramer\'s Charitable Trust is long AMZN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

    text: 'Lindsey Nicholson | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nWould you be bothered if your coat was officially classified as a windbreaker or a raincoat, or your shoes as slippers? Probably not. Businesses do care though, as classifications under a preferred category can help them pay lower tariff rates.\n\nAs U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on friends and foes alike, manufacturers are increasingly rethinking the classification of their products and resorting to "tariff engineering" to incur lower duties, several customs lawyers, supply chain and shipping experts told CNBC.\n\nTariff engineering \u2014 a legal practice that precedes Trump \u2014 involves changing an item\'s materials, altering its dimensions or compositions so that the finished products can be justified to fit in a different "harmonized system code," experts said.\n\nAlthough most new tariffs added during Trump\'s second term are broad-based, the U.S. government has carved out exemptions for certain products, leaving doors open for companies to benefit through tariff engineering, trade lawyers pointed out.\n\nAfter Trump unveiled sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs in April, several overseas manufacturers moved to bundle steel and aluminum elements into their final products to qualify a lower 25% duty under Section 232, said David Forgue, a partner at Chicago law firm Barnes, Richardson & Colburn.\n\nThings, however, changed quickly in June as Trump jacked up tariffs on all steel, aluminum products and derivatives to 50%, except those from the U.K. "Now that the duties are reversed, we\'re now seeing companies remove those elements and ship them separately again," Forgue said.\n\nTariff engineering is one of the few things you can do to try to get it right and reduce your duty liability.\n\nJohn Foote\n\nCustoms lawyer, Kelley Drye & Warren\n\nThere is "nothing inherently illegal or even untoward about leveraging strategic design choices that result in creating different products that are subject to different tariff classification and duty rates," said John Foote, a customs lawyer at Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington D.C. "Tariff engineering is one of the few things you can do to try to get it right and reduce your duty liability."\n\nThere are over 5,000 different product classification codes that U.S. customs authority uses while assessing tariffs. These tariff classifications were determined through decades of negotiations between governments and industry bodies, often varying by product category.\n\nIzzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of logistics firm Portless, said that one of his clients, who manufactured hoodies, ditched synthetic materials for cotton in their production, saving more than 15% in duty costs.\n\nWinnebago Industries, an American manufacturer of motorhomes, or recreational vehicles, said in its quarterly earnings call in March that it planned to "work with outside experts to develop and implement effective [tariff] mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering and deferrals."\n\nGeorge Frey | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAneel Salman, chair of economic security at Islamabad Policy Research Institute, described the act as "clever art of outsmarting customs," as importers and manufacturers tweak products "just enough" to qualify for lower duties.\n\nSmart plays\n\n"I was talking to somebody recently and they were showing me their lapel pin," said Kelley Drye & Warren\'s Foote. The pin, tacked onto the person\'s suit, featured a "festive design" with pieces of cubic zirconia at the back, Foote said.\n\nThe inclusion of cubic zirconia helped the company that manufactures those pins avert a 14% tariff, as the item no longer fell under the festive article category but got classified as jewelry, Foote subsequently learnt.\n\n"The value attributable to the cubic zirconia was significant enough [and] it was a relatively easy manufacturing change," Foote said.\n\nThe practice of tariff engineering can be traced back to 1882, when an importer coated sugar with molasses to avoid higher duties imposed on lighter-colored sugar. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court ruled the act perfectly legal: "so long as the goods are truly invoiced and freely and honestly exposed to the officers of customs for their examination, no fraud is committed."\n\nSince then, companies, big and small, have continued to play chess with the U.S. tariff classification system, with several household names successfully implementing strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs.\n\nFor instance, Columbia Sportswear has never been shy about its use of tariff engineering. "I have a whole team of people that work together with designers and developers and merchandisers and with customs, and to ensure that during the design process that we\'re considering the impact of tariffs," Jeff Tooze, the company\'s vice president of global customs and trade, told Marketplace during Trump\'s first term.\n\nAmong its alterations, the company added small zippered pockets below the waist on women\'s shirts, allowing them to be exempted from higher duties under the U.S. customs rules.\n\nSimilarly, footwear maker Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to the soles of its signature All Stars sneakers, rather than the typical full-rubber one, to be categorized as slippers rather than athletic shoes, helping it cut tariffs drastically.\n\nSnuggies, the fluffy blanket with sleeves imported mainly from China, nearly halved its tariff costs by winning a lawsuit in 2017 classifying it as a blanket, not an item of clothing.\n\nGary Hershorn | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nFast-moving consumer goods and garments, apparel and footwear sectors can find it relatively easy to implement tariff engineering, said Andrew Wilson, supply chain strategist at consultancy Supplino Inc.\n\nFor more sophisticated and "heavily-regulated" sectors such as automotive, aerospace, electronics and medical devices, "it\'s especially challenging ... because even minor changes may require extensive validation and approval," Wilson said.\n\n"You might be looking at another 12 to 24 months of testing, certification and validation in order to get that done," Wilson added, as it requires extensive collaboration across departments, including design, engineering and legal teams.\n\nRules of interpretation\n\nCompanies have to tread a fine between between redesigning their products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications.\n\nA case in point illustrating the challenges with tariff engineering is Ford Motor. The automaker had for years imported its Transit Connect van as a passenger van, then removed the second row seats to sell them as cargo vans. In doing so, Ford circumvented a hefty 25% tariff and only paid a 2.5% import duty.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said in its ruling last year that Ford was "misclassifying cargo vans" and that the back-row seats "were never intended to be, and never were, used to carry passengers."\n\nwatch now\n\n"The article must be a \'commercial reality\' at importation. The risk is that customs [may] find the changes to be "fraud or artifice," [that case] the tariff engineering may be rejected,\u201d said Forgue.\n\n"In some cases, changing certain things about a product doesn\'t change the essential character of what the good is," said Derek Scarbrough, founder of Global Logistical Connections. "If you add something to a shopping cart, it\'s still a shopping cart," he added.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection has developed a so-called "binding ruling" system where companies can obtain official determinations on product classifications and HTS codes before importing.\n\nAdam Lees, an attorney at law firm Harris Sliwoski, who has helped clients prepare such ruling letter requests, described it as "a way for companies to get CBP\'s official blessing" before shipment.\n\nSome companies, however, may be deterred from seeking such official rulings, as a potential unfavorable ruling could be constraining. "You\'re stuck using whatever they said, and if they disagree, all of a sudden, you can\'t go under the radar anymore," Scarbrough said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC\'s Dylan Butts contributed to this report.',

    text: 'A glitch in the system regarding the code to exempt all freight that was on the water this week and should be exempt from any new tariffs put into place by the Trump administration, including freight already on the way from China and any nations now under a 90-day reprieve, has now been fixed.\n\nThe glitch lasted for more than 10 hours, according to the latest alert provided by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe alert explained that U.S. Customs had deployed an "immediate correction to the issue reported earlier today" in which the Automated Commercial Environment did not accept the lower duty rate of 10% for entries that properly qualify as in-transit shipments filed since April 9.\n\nCustoms said with this update, "articles the product of countries that have an additional country-specific rate of duty that were (1) loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transport on or after 12:01 a.m. EDT April 5, 2025, and before 12:01 a.m. EDT April 9, 2025, and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. EDT on May 27 2025, should claim the 10% additional rate in lieu of the country-specific rate of duty."\n\nCBP also added that users will "need to resubmit the applicable entry summaries in the Automated Commercial Environment that qualify for the in transit provision as soon as possible and within ten days of the date of release."\n\nCBP also said it "will continue to ensure all tariff revenue due to the United States is collected and will provide additional guidance to the trade community through CSMS messages as appropriate."\n\nCustoms issued an update at 8:19 a.m. that they were aware the entry code for U.S. shippers to use to have their freight exempted was not working and "the issue is being reviewed."\n\nIn the alert, Customs advised filers "to transmit cargo release separately and follow up with the summary filing when resolved."\n\nNormally, when a U.S. importer pays for their freight, they file both the cargo release forms and their financial papers, so they can pay for their cargo. To keep the cargo moving, Customs is advising importers to file the cargo release form now, and file the financial form later, once the glitch is corrected.\n\nThe tariffs being paused on many nation\'s trade, and the Chinese tariffs still in effect, are based on the sailing date, or the date the freight leaves the factory or warehouse. This is called an "on the water" clause and is in effect for all freight bound to the U.S. that has been on the water before the April 5, 9, and 10 tariff announcements.\n\nThe "on the water" clause has not changed, even though the China tariff percentages have increased to 145% and a series of other recent tariffs have been put in place.\n\nFor U.S. shippers and the supply chain, it\'s the latest blow at a time of uncertainty and fear about tariffs policy. It also raises questions about Customs\' ability to handle the new policy and collect the tariffs revenue that is key to the Trump administration\'s economic goals.\n\nInterpretations of the multiple executive orders, social media posts, and customs alerts have some U.S. companies and industry groups trying to figure out when the new tariffs will be deployed.\n\n"There has been some confusion on what President Trump has said in social media posts on when the tariff starts and what is written in the executive order," said Jarred Varanelli, vice president of U.S. sales at logistics firm Savino Del Bene. "Social media posts are not law on the pause and increase in tariffs. With the constant changes to the regulations, all customs brokers in our industry have a difficult task ahead of them."\n\nDespite President Donald Trump saying numerous times tariffs are in effect and being collected, U.S. shippers told CNBC they have not been charged higher tariff rates on their containers, some of which came in as late as Thursday.\n\nDewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at Longview Global with a focus on international trade, foreign affairs and defense, told CNBC glitches do happen, but the timing is unfortunate and will lead to more questions about Customs\' ability to keep up with the pace of the tariffs.\n\n"Whether you agree or disagree with the policy, you have to ask, do we have the ability to do it this rapidly?" said McNeal. "This glitch may be an indication we need more time. It seems odd this is the time it happens. This adds policy chaos for the implementer."\n\nTo keep the freight moving, Customs is telling firms to pay the duties and tariffs within ten days of the cargo\'s release to Customs.\n\n"It\'s a mess, to simply state it," said McNeal. "I don\'t think it will slow down goods. But it will increase the paperwork for the U.S. companies who are suffering tariff whiplash. These companies will need to refile that at a later date. Trade will flow but at greater complexity."\n\nThe CPB said in a statement to CNBC that since April 5, it has collected over $500 million under the new tariffs, and $21 billion in total tariff revenue under new trade actions implemented since Jan 20, 2025.\n\nThe U.S. is currently at work on negotiations with over 75 countries on tariffs deals that Trump has said will be tailored to each nation.\n\nThe uncertainty at Customs entry points come within the context of much greater business anxiety.\n\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a three-generation educational toy company which makes its products in China, said this year it was scheduled to expand with the construction of a new building, but now he is pausing expansion and reviewing his company\'s financials to see where cuts can be made.\n\n"I cannot run my business based on social media posts," said Woldenberg. "This is making it difficult for me to make my business decisions. Instead of planning on growth, I\'m talking about surviving. This trade policy can kill me and hundreds of small businesses like me. This will eliminate jobs. The banking industry and insurance industry that serve businesses both large and small will be impacted if companies go bankrupt."\n\nWoldenberg expects massive disruption. "The interconnectedness of all of this is not well understood. This policy was crafted with little interest in the details. It\'s these details that will drive business and the economy down the toilet."',

    text: 'U.S. importers are being notified of an increase in canceled sailings by freight ships out of China as ocean carriers try to balance the pullback in orders resulting from President Trump\'s tariffs and the escalation of tensions in the trade war.\n\nA total of 80 blank, or canceled, sailings out of China have been recorded by freight company HLS Group. It wrote in a recent note to clients that with the trade war between China and the U.S. leading to a demand plummet, carriers have started to suspend or adjust transpacific services.\n\nMajor ocean freight alliance ONE has "suspended until further notice" a route it had previously been planning to bring back in May, which would include ports of Qingdao, Ningbo, Shanghai, Pusan, Vancouver, and Tacoma. Meanwhile, an existing route is planning to cancel its port call at Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nThe impact of the diminished freight container traffic to North America will be significant for many links in the economy and supply chain, including the ports and logistics companies moving the freight. If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage.\n\nThe World Trade Organization warned on Wednesday that the outlook for global trade has "deteriorated sharply" in the wake of Trump\'s tariffs plan. JB Hunt shares hit their lowest level since November 2020 after commentary during the trucking company\'s earnings call about the uncertainty from tariffs.\n\n"We have no way of knowing how significant this drop in orders will be on vessel schedules," said Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence. "There are no models to extrapolate this. What I can tell you is the majority of containers on the vessels servicing the Asia to U.S. trade routes is China. We won\'t go to zero containers, but we will see a decrease in containers and as a result, in the future, we will see a massive raft of blank sailings announced."\n\nChina accounts for approximately 30% of all U.S. containerized imports (down from 37% in 2018), but accounts for approximately 54% of all U.S. containerized imports from Asia (down from 67% in 2018).\n\nAs a result of the decrease in containers, ocean carriers will not only cancel vessels, but also adjust or cancel vessel routes commonly called "vessel strings," such as the ONE service from China to Vancouver and Tacoma. These routes dedicating vessels to move the ocean freight at specific ports take months of planning. The elimination of vessels also impacts U.S. exports bound for Asia and relying on ships traveling in both directions.\n\nOcean carriers need to move full vessels to generate a return on investment, but it is not in their best interest to use large vessels if they cannot be filled. To ensure vessels are used at full capacity, carriers have a number of ways to alter the vessel strings. Stretching out ship arrivals by canceling sailings is an option for container volume to better match capacity. According to Murphy, 99% of vessel services are weekly and it takes a vessel approximately seven weeks to make a round trip.\n\n"During Covid, ocean carriers parked their vessels for maintenance," Murphy said. "Ocean carriers can also blank (cancel) a sailing, omit vessel strings entirely, use smaller vessels, or slow steam the vessels where they are traveling longer."\n\nThese measures will cut the available vessel capacity for containers, according to Murphy, which helps remaining ships to be filled, with uncertain implications for overall pricing in the ocean freight business. While a decline in sailings could lead to a drop in prices, during Covid, blank sailings were identified by shippers around the world as a reason for container rates that spiked as high as $30,000. In that case, shippers say the ocean carriers canceled sailings for longer than needed.\n\nVietnam continues to gain on China\n\nThe global supply chain demand and pricing situation remains fluid and subject to sharp short-term swings tied to tariffs policy. As Chinese trade comes under strain, a key metric in ocean freight rates shows Vietnam surging in early April.\n\nThe "mid-low" ocean rates, which represent the costs of shipping goods for a larger-sized shipper on a particular ocean route, have jumped by 43% since March 30 for Vietnam. Xeneta calculates the market mid-low and market mid-high segments by looking at the values of the 25 and 75 percentiles of a trade lane rate.\n\n"The fact that the lower end of the market has been rising shows the heat is on," said Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta. He said that is continuing after Trump\'s decision to pause what he called "reciprocal" tariffs on countries other than China for 90 days.\n\n"Shippers large and small all have to pay up for frontloading, as the \'pause\' made the pulling forward of freight possible again," Sand added.',

    text: 'Sharing the costs of hosting U.S. troops in allied countries has been a favorite topic of U.S. President Donald Trump since his first term in the White House.\n\nBut as more countries try to eke out a deal to escape the spectre of tariffs in his second term, Trump is making his own moves: bundling negotiations on trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing into a single comprehensive deal, which he called "one-stop shopping."\n\nOne such country in his sights is South Korea, which is home to about 28,500 U.S. troops known as U.S. Forces Korea. On April 8, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had discussed "payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea," among other issues, with then-acting president Han Duck-soo.\n\n"We are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. "ONE STOP SHOPPING" is a beautiful and efficient process!!!" Trump wrote.\n\nWhile South Korean officials have reportedly said that defense payments are off the table, the country\'s two leading presidential candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have hinted that they are open to discussing a defense cost-sharing agreement.\n\nHowever, analysts told CNBC that a transactional approach wouldn\'t necessarily work in the U.S.\'s favor.\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February, then-Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said, "It has been said that trade and security are two sides of the same coin, and one assumes that as trade dependencies shift, security alliances will follow."\n\nBut, the image of the U.S. in Asia, Ng said, "has changed from liberator to great disruptor to a landlord seeking rent."\n\nThe U.S. president is likely to bring defense payments up in trade talks, Bruce Bennett, Professor of Policy Analysis at the RAND School of Public Policy, told CNBC.\n\n"It\'s the way he does business," Bennett said. "So it\'s not like he definitely wants to bring troops home, but it is a matter that he wants the recognition and the acceptance of responsibility from our allies," he added.\n\nOne way South Korea could "pay more" is by investing in its forces and buying more U.S. military equipment, Bennett said.\n\nThis will enable the South Korean military to plug any capability gaps while allowing U.S. Forces Korea to focus more on China, he added.\n\n"[If] the Korean government says we\'re volunteering to ...raise our budget by $3 or $4 billion, we\'re going to use it to buy equipment so that the U.S. can have a shift in focus, I think that would go a long way to meeting the President\'s interests."\n\nThis was the stance espoused by U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, who said in a 2024 interview that U.S. Forces Korea should be overhauled to be "more relevant" to handling China, as opposed to North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea spent 2.6% of its GDP on defense in 2024, more than the global average of 2.5%, and one of the highest in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nIn 2025, the country allocated 61.25 trillion South Korean won ($43.83 billion) for defense, or a 3.1% increase from the year before.\n\nHowever, such a transactional approach could devalue U.S. credibility, Hoshik Nam, assistant professor at the Department of Sociology and Political Science at Jacksonville State University, said.\n\nNam explained the U.S.-led global order has enabled the U.S. to maintain its influence across different parts of the world for several decades, but Trump\'s transactional view of relationships with other countries suggests that the large-scale deployment of U.S. forces may not align with his policy preferences.\n\nAs such, this global order is likely to go through significant changes, "potentially shifting the U.S. back toward a more isolationist stance," he said.\n\nUsing the deployment of U.S. forces as leverage in trade negotiations could lead close allies to perceive U.S. commitments as less credible, Nam also added.\n\n"In the long term, this position could reframe the U.S. as an isolated superpower."\n\nSouth Korea wasn\'t required to make any financial contribution in its original 1966 agreement with the U.S on troops stationed in the country, known as the Status of Forces Agreement.\n\nCost sharing only became a feature of the alliance in 1991, when Seoul agreed to share some of the burden of stationing U.S. troops in three areas, namely logistics, local labor, and military construction.\n\nNam explained that South Korea\'s rapid economic growth from the 1960s created the conditions for cost-sharing.\n\n"Both countries also agreed that their relationship should move beyond a simple aid-provider and recipient dynamic," he noted.\n\nThe funds provided by the South Korean government through the cost-sharing agreement actually benefits the economy by also creating local jobs and helping domestic industries, Nam said.\n\n"Regarding construction, most projects are carried out by Korean construction companies. In terms of logistics, the equipment, services, and facilities are all supplied by Korean companies," Nam highlighted.\n\nIn October 2024, Seoul agreed to raise its contribution for hosting U.S. troops by 8.3% in 2026, to 1.52 trillion won ($1.13 billion).\n\nHowever, Trump\'s \'one stop shopping\' stance to bundle trade with defense agreements could throw the latest cost-sharing agreement by the Biden administration into jeopardy, given that the 2024 agreement covers the period of 2026-2030.',

    text: 'A new wave of ocean freight from China is beginning to arrive at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, an increased flow of shipping containers aiming to beat potential tariff increases. President Trump imposed a deadline of August 12 for the U.S. and China to agree to a trade deal.\n\nIn recent days, the vessel tracking service managed by the Marine Exchange of Southern California and Coast Guard showed an uptick in ship arrivals: Friday (64), Saturday (68), and Sunday (64).\n\n"This is a pretty solid forecast of an increase in container ship arrivals in the next one to two weeks," said Captain J. Kipling (Kip) Louttit, executive director of MX SoCal. He said it is the highest number of container ships on the way to the nation\'s busiest ports since January 2025 (previous highs were in July and September 2024).\n\nThe forecast for the coming weeks encompasses the average of container ships coming from the far reaches of Asia that are 16 days out, those coming from Oakland and San Diego which are one day out, and others on the way from the Panama Canal, South and Central America, Mexico, Hawaii, and Alaska, with transit times in between.\n\nThe increase in containers was expected, and officials have stopped short of describing it as a "surge." There is no expectation of sustained high levels \u2014 ocean freight booking orders fell after a couple of weeks of increased orders. There is no expectation of congestion at the West Coast ports, either, due to recent softness in container traffic. The trade war has led many U.S. importers to place a pause on orders, and vessels arriving into the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach before the new wave have not been full.\n\nThe terminals at the Port of Long Beach are operating at about 60 percent of capacity. Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, tells CNBC the port is well prepared to handle the expected uptick in vessel traffic over the next several weeks and beyond.\n\nCanceled sailings at Long Beach \u2014 many shippers cancelled planned freight vessel voyages earlier this year during the initial stages of Trump\'s trade war \u2014 are trending down, from an expected 18 in June to only 4 for July and August combined, Cordero said.\n\n"We\'ve been coordinating closely with terminal operators, labor, and our other partners to ensure they have what they need as we look forward to increased cargo flow. We welcome the additional cargo and look forward to a resolution of the trade policy issues that have led to so much uncertainty for shippers," he added.\n\nThe terminals at the Port of Los Angeles are operating at 70% of capacity. Gene Seroka, executive director for the Port of Los Angeles, noted in its monthly container update that the port would see some signs of peak season orders in the month of July arrivals. But he added, "retailers are not telling me that they\'re boosting inventory levels to have wide selections on products beginning that Thanksgiving week and running to the end of the year. So I\'m not seeing that either."\n\nThe terminals at the Port of Los Angeles are operating at less than 30% of the cargo on the docks today than at the peak during Covid. "We\'ve got plenty of room to manage the cargo," Seroka said in the update.\n\nVessels now arriving are anticipated to be full. This increase in containers will be a boost for trucking, railroads and warehouse companies who get paid by the freight load.\n\nSeroka told CNBC that the uptick in cargo in recent weeks compared to May "has put more people back to work on our docks."\n\nHe added that the cargo flow is still below normal for the month of June, and "there are looming trade negotiation deadlines in July and August that will impact volume forecasts for the remainder of the year."',

    text: 'Lindsey Nicholson | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nWould you be bothered if your coat was officially classified as a windbreaker or a raincoat, or your shoes as slippers? Probably not. Businesses do care though, as classifications under a preferred category can help them pay lower tariff rates.\n\nAs U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on friends and foes alike, manufacturers are increasingly rethinking the classification of their products and resorting to "tariff engineering" to incur lower duties, several customs lawyers, supply chain and shipping experts told CNBC.\n\nTariff engineering \u2014 a legal practice that precedes Trump \u2014 involves changing an item\'s materials, altering its dimensions or compositions so that the finished products can be justified to fit in a different "harmonized system code," experts said.\n\nAlthough most new tariffs added during Trump\'s second term are broad-based, the U.S. government has carved out exemptions for certain products, leaving doors open for companies to benefit through tariff engineering, trade lawyers pointed out.\n\nAfter Trump unveiled sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs in April, several overseas manufacturers moved to bundle steel and aluminum elements into their final products to qualify a lower 25% duty under Section 232, said David Forgue, a partner at Chicago law firm Barnes, Richardson & Colburn.\n\nThings, however, changed quickly in June as Trump jacked up tariffs on all steel, aluminum products and derivatives to 50%, except those from the U.K. "Now that the duties are reversed, we\'re now seeing companies remove those elements and ship them separately again," Forgue said.\n\nTariff engineering is one of the few things you can do to try to get it right and reduce your duty liability.\n\nJohn Foote\n\nCustoms lawyer, Kelley Drye & Warren\n\nThere is "nothing inherently illegal or even untoward about leveraging strategic design choices that result in creating different products that are subject to different tariff classification and duty rates," said John Foote, a customs lawyer at Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington D.C. "Tariff engineering is one of the few things you can do to try to get it right and reduce your duty liability."\n\nThere are over 5,000 different product classification codes that U.S. customs authority uses while assessing tariffs. These tariff classifications were determined through decades of negotiations between governments and industry bodies, often varying by product category.\n\nIzzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of logistics firm Portless, said that one of his clients, who manufactured hoodies, ditched synthetic materials for cotton in their production, saving more than 15% in duty costs.\n\nWinnebago Industries, an American manufacturer of motorhomes, or recreational vehicles, said in its quarterly earnings call in March that it planned to "work with outside experts to develop and implement effective [tariff] mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering and deferrals."\n\nGeorge Frey | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAneel Salman, chair of economic security at Islamabad Policy Research Institute, described the act as "clever art of outsmarting customs," as importers and manufacturers tweak products "just enough" to qualify for lower duties.\n\nSmart plays\n\n"I was talking to somebody recently and they were showing me their lapel pin," said Kelley Drye & Warren\'s Foote. The pin, tacked onto the person\'s suit, featured a "festive design" with pieces of cubic zirconia at the back, Foote said.\n\nThe inclusion of cubic zirconia helped the company that manufactures those pins avert a 14% tariff, as the item no longer fell under the festive article category but got classified as jewelry, Foote subsequently learnt.\n\n"The value attributable to the cubic zirconia was significant enough [and] it was a relatively easy manufacturing change," Foote said.\n\nThe practice of tariff engineering can be traced back to 1882, when an importer coated sugar with molasses to avoid higher duties imposed on lighter-colored sugar. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court ruled the act perfectly legal: "so long as the goods are truly invoiced and freely and honestly exposed to the officers of customs for their examination, no fraud is committed."\n\nSince then, companies, big and small, have continued to play chess with the U.S. tariff classification system, with several household names successfully implementing strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs.\n\nFor instance, Columbia Sportswear has never been shy about its use of tariff engineering. "I have a whole team of people that work together with designers and developers and merchandisers and with customs, and to ensure that during the design process that we\'re considering the impact of tariffs," Jeff Tooze, the company\'s vice president of global customs and trade, told Marketplace during Trump\'s first term.\n\nAmong its alterations, the company added small zippered pockets below the waist on women\'s shirts, allowing them to be exempted from higher duties under the U.S. customs rules.\n\nSimilarly, footwear maker Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to the soles of its signature All Stars sneakers, rather than the typical full-rubber one, to be categorized as slippers rather than athletic shoes, helping it cut tariffs drastically.\n\nSnuggies, the fluffy blanket with sleeves imported mainly from China, nearly halved its tariff costs by winning a lawsuit in 2017 classifying it as a blanket, not an item of clothing.\n\nGary Hershorn | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nFast-moving consumer goods and garments, apparel and footwear sectors can find it relatively easy to implement tariff engineering, said Andrew Wilson, supply chain strategist at consultancy Supplino Inc.\n\nFor more sophisticated and "heavily-regulated" sectors such as automotive, aerospace, electronics and medical devices, "it\'s especially challenging ... because even minor changes may require extensive validation and approval," Wilson said.\n\n"You might be looking at another 12 to 24 months of testing, certification and validation in order to get that done," Wilson added, as it requires extensive collaboration across departments, including design, engineering and legal teams.\n\nRules of interpretation\n\nCompanies have to tread a fine between between redesigning their products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications.\n\nA case in point illustrating the challenges with tariff engineering is Ford Motor. The automaker had for years imported its Transit Connect van as a passenger van, then removed the second row seats to sell them as cargo vans. In doing so, Ford circumvented a hefty 25% tariff and only paid a 2.5% import duty.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said in its ruling last year that Ford was "misclassifying cargo vans" and that the back-row seats "were never intended to be, and never were, used to carry passengers."\n\nwatch now\n\n"The article must be a \'commercial reality\' at importation. The risk is that customs [may] find the changes to be "fraud or artifice," [that case] the tariff engineering may be rejected,\u201d said Forgue.\n\n"In some cases, changing certain things about a product doesn\'t change the essential character of what the good is," said Derek Scarbrough, founder of Global Logistical Connections. "If you add something to a shopping cart, it\'s still a shopping cart," he added.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection has developed a so-called "binding ruling" system where companies can obtain official determinations on product classifications and HTS codes before importing.\n\nAdam Lees, an attorney at law firm Harris Sliwoski, who has helped clients prepare such ruling letter requests, described it as "a way for companies to get CBP\'s official blessing" before shipment.\n\nSome companies, however, may be deterred from seeking such official rulings, as a potential unfavorable ruling could be constraining. "You\'re stuck using whatever they said, and if they disagree, all of a sudden, you can\'t go under the radar anymore," Scarbrough said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC\'s Dylan Butts contributed to this report.',

    text: 'Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly set to boost its manufacturing in India with a view to bolstering its international supply chains amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe Chinese-founded, Singapore-headquartered brand and Indian partner Reliance Retail are set to expand their supplier base in the South Asian country and begin international sales of India-made Shein clothes within the next six to 12 months, Reuters reported Monday, citing sources.\n\nThe plans aim to increase Indian suppliers from 150 to 1,000 within a year, they added.\n\nShein told CNBC the partnership was limited to the licensing of its brand to Reliance Retail for Indian domestic consumption only. Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the sources, discussions between the firms were underway ahead of fresh U.S. tariffs on China and the closure of the former\'s \'de minimis\' trade loophole.\n\nAnalysts nevertheless dubbed it a potentially savvy move given brewing trade tensions and increased scrutiny over Shein\'s supply chains ahead of its closely watched initial public offering.\n\n\'\'Shein\'s expansion of its production in India is on the face of it a shrewd move, given the trade headwinds facing the company," Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email.\n\n"It does look like using India as a manufacturing base is a long-term plan and the current tariff challenges could speed this up," Ed Sander, analyst at Tech Buzz China, added.\n\nShein launched in India in 2018 but it was banned in 2020 as part of a government clampdown on Chinese firms.\n\nIt returned to India in February, as part of a licensing deal with Reliance Industries, the conglomerate owned by Asia\'s richest person, Mukesh Ambani. The partnership is one of many Reliance has with global clothing brands including Brooks Brothers, Marks & Spencer and Diesel.\n\nUnder the deal, Shein-branded clothes are produced domestically in India and sold on the SheinIndia.in website. This differs from most other Shein websites, which list products made in China. The firm nevertheless has existing manufacturing in Brazil and Turkey.\n\nAn official from Reliance Retail said at the time that Shein would use India as "supply source for its global operations," according to the BBC. They added that the deal would simultaneously help Reliance in "building the network" and training Indian garment manufacturers as part of India\'s wider plans to promote its textile and garments export industry.\n\n"I doubt if the option of exporting elsewhere from India will be the main aim at the moment," Sander said, noting current limitations around India\'s factory capacity. "Having said that, this could change in the future if Reliance scales up."\n\nIt comes as other companies have also been ramping up their production in India as they seek to avoid the most punitive tariffs on China. Tariffs on India are currently held at 10% while trade negotiations remain underway.\n\n"While a trade deal between India and the U.S. is not a guarantee, this move could mitigate some of the harm to Shein\'s business from a more severe U.S./China trade war," Samuel Kerr, head of global equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said.\n\n"With the outcome of U.S. China trade talks still unclear, diversifying the manufacturing base to other parts of the world which could benefit from lower tariffs on exports to the U.S. looks sensible," Streeter added.\n\nU.S. tech giant Apple has also been boosting its production in India with a view to making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the coming years. Those plans sparked backlash from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose 25% tariffs on such goods.\n\nThe timing is especially interesting for Shein, however, as it seeks to overcome scrutiny in its troubled pursuit of an IPO. The e-commerce behemoth reportedly recently shifted its listing from London to Hong Kong after failing to receive approval from Chinese regulators.\n\nShein has long sought to shake allegations over the use of forced labor to produce its low-cost goods \u2014 claims it vehemently denies. Still, some raised concerns about whether India would provide the silver bullet.\n\n"India is not without risk in this respect. There have been reports of labor violations amounting to forced and child labor occurring on cotton farms supplying to three Indian textile suppliers to 60 multinational clothing brands," Streeter said.\n\n"Among responsible consumers and investors, there still may be significant skepticism about this move.\'\'\n\nA spokesperson for the Indian government did not immediately respond to CNBC\'s request for comment on the claims.',

    text: 'Tariffs reminded American businesses how much they still rely on Chinese factories.\n\nNow, as more of those factories turn to tech \u2014 such as artificial intelligence and robotics \u2014 for cost-cutting and quality controls, it\'s going to be even harder to resist buying from China. AI\'s potential to transform manufacturing was even highlighted by venture capitalist Mary Meeker over the weekend in the first of her widely followed tech trends reports since 2019.\n\nChinese companies are eager to adopt new technologies, and startup Cybord believes its AI-powered quality control tools will find big buyers in China this year, said CEO Oshri Cohen.\n\nRather than using generative AI, Cybord applies supervised machine learning to identify flaws based on patterns in its manufacturing component database, Cohen said. These flaws include counterfeit, defective and tampered components. Last month, the startup announced it is being integrated into factory management systems from industrial giant Siemens .\n\nCohen, who was previously a vice president of supply chain at Nvidia, expects geopolitical pressures to diversify supply chains, making Chinese factories more competitive. "Factories will go back to China," he said, but in contrast to the past decade, China will then "be a statement of high quality."\n\nChina installed seven times more robots than the U.S. in 2023, accounting for more than half of the industrial robots installed in the world, according to Stanford University, citing a report from the International Federation of Robotics.\n\nStill, automation levels are uneven, with some sectors, such as autos, requiring fewer human workers, while production lines such as apparel, still rely significantly on people running machines by hand.\n\nBeijing has ambitious plans to digitalize the country\'s factories further \u2014 in the next five years.\n\nChina last month released an "action plan" for digital supply chain development by 2030. It called for using AI, blockchain and other technologies in manufacturing and agriculture \u2014 including a plan to cultivate 100 digital supply chain leaders.\n\nThe country already has a head start.\n\n"When you think about digital transformations and the use of digital analytics of automation in manufacturing, the Chinese companies are a real force in the world," said Karel Eloot, a Shenzhen-based senior partner at McKinsey.\n\nHe pointed out that since the World Economic Forum and McKinsey started tracking factory digitalization in 2018, the number of exemplary use cases has climbed to 189, of which 41% are based in China and spread across multiple industries. They include Chinese appliance maker Midea and the Chinese operations of GE Healthcare, AstraZeneca and Schneider Electric.\n\nThe report noted that some companies, such as the Hisense-Hitachi joint venture in Qingdao, China, are utilizing generative AI to reduce time spent on inefficient meetings, instead directing the next shift of workers to immediate issues.\n\nCompanies are looking for ways to improve productivity, all the way from the supply chain to the consumer, Eloot said, noting there is a growing "gap between the haves and have-nots" in terms of AI manufacturing integration.\n\n"The competitive forces in China are very strong," he said. "Companies compete with each other in a very ruthless way, I would say."\n\nThe cutthroat nature of that competition was on full display in recent weeks with yet another round of electric car price cuts \u2014 largely led by BYD , which already dominates the market and has been aggressively expanding globally.\n\nBYD stated in its 2024 annual report that it has begun deploying autonomous mobile logistics robots for manufacturing. The automaker has also invested in robotics companies.\n\n"Supply chains have become so efficient and so competitive from a cost perspective ... that if you are to compete, you have to be here" in China, Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters last week in Beijing.\n\nHe said he\'s concerned about China\'s plans to potentially double down on self-sufficiency, which would likely prompt a reaction from its main trading partners. "If you still want to have a workable relationship with your main trading partners, you also need to have a commitment to actually trade," he said.\n\nOther car companies, such as Nio and Geely, have also made a major focus of their development.\n\nAI applications may even prompt a reorganization of the automotive industry, said Zhou Zipeng, executive general manager at CICC Research Institute. While challenges still exist in data collection and storage, AI is already being used for lithium battery material development and chip manufacturing in China, Zhou said.\n\nOn the software side, Chinese tech giant Alibaba announced a strategic partnership with business management system giant SAP last week. The wide-ranging agreement \u2014 which initially focuses on China \u2014 includes Alibaba Cloud support for SAP\'s supply chain management system, and plans to test integrating Alibaba\'s Qwen AI model with SAP\'s applications in China.\n\nWhile it\'s still early days, generative AI can quickly create a large number of design solutions, shortening the time to a product launch, said Glenn Hou, founding partner of China Insights Consultancy. He added that generative AI can improve the efficiency of equipment maintenance and help businesses absorb technical expertise more quickly.\n\n"Looking ahead to the next year, the integration of AI and manufacturing is expected to accelerate," Hou said in Chinese, translated by CNBC. He noted how a combination of data, algorithms and use cases has become a new competitive barrier to entry for businesses.',

    text: 'The U.S. trade deficit fell by the largest amount on record in April as imports fell by over 16% after a surge in orders to beat President Trump\'s tariffs, but there\'s a worrying flip side for the consumer. As the trade war whipsaws global economic activity, supply chain data shows that the retail inventory crunch could be next and small business across the country are bearing the brunt of the pain. From freight orders to inventory and warehousing, the latest logistics data shows the inability of many importers to make business decisions related to inventory levels.\n\nOne closely watched data point is the widening gap between inventory levels and inventory costs. These metrics generally track together, according to the Logistics Managers\' Index. In 2024, the average space between these metrics was 12.1 points. But in May 2025, the gap has expanded to 26.8 points, the third-highest in the history of the index, said Zachary Rogers, associate professor of supply chain management and Colorado State University Supply Chain Management Forum director.\n\nWhen inventories are high and quickly expand, warehouses cost more. Traditionally, when warehouse inventories decrease, warehouse costs slow down as well. But because of the front-loading of products ahead of the tariffs in the January-March period, inventory is flat, with replenishment orders not coming in. But costs are still up because the inventory is being held longer.\n\n"The situation we\'re in now, inventories are up, and they\'re sitting there," said Rogers. "Essentially, imports in January, February, and early March looked a lot like what we would normally see in August, September, and early October."\n\nNormally in mid-October, holiday sales kick into gear, which would move inventory out of the warehouse. But given the uncertainty in tariffs and concerns about the financial health of the consumer, retailers have told CNBC they are not placing full orders.\n\n"Warehousing capacity is tight, which means there is no inventory movement, and the associated costs (e.g., warehousing prices and inventory costs) are much higher than what we would normally see at this time of the year," Rogers said. "This means the inventory is getting more expensive to hold."\n\nOcean freight orders from around the world to the U.S. show the pause button in product orders continues.\n\nThe conditions in the freight market resulted in an advantage for larger firms over small businesses, according to Rogers. "Smaller firms were boxed out during the big rush of imports in Q1, so they have had to bring inventories over later, resulting in higher costs," he said.\n\nBut since the larger companies aren\'t continuing to stock up, as the surge ends it is impacting smaller supply chain companies directly, too. The smaller firms in the Logistics Managers\' Index survey sample are representative of the "middle mile" in supply chains, wholesalers and logistics service providers at the points in the supply chain where freight is transported between a supplier\'s warehouse, distribution center and the final destination of delivery, which could be a retail store or a customer\'s doorstep.\n\nThey get hit when large manufacturers and retailers avoid inventory as much as possible \u2014 unlike the Covid shock era, they are now running leaner inventory overall, which further squeezes the "middle mile."\n\n"Essentially, it is the small businesses of America that are bearing the brunt of the tariffs right now," Rogers said. "This could change as inventories move downstream to retailers if costs could be passed down to the consumer," he added.\n\nRecent Federal Reserve survey data shows many firms planning to pass on price increases resulting from tariffs to customers.\n\nBut the ability to pass on price increases to customers varies business to business, and based on end customer. Helen Torkos, president and owner of Regent Tek Industries, which manufactures pavement markings, tells CNBC the global trade war has greatly impacted the cost of importing the raw components needed to manufacture the highest grade of thermoplastic road markings, the product that is on state, city, and local roads and highways.\n\n"The majority of our components are now being tariffed," said Torkos. "Our cost has gone up tenfold. We cannot pass on these costs to some of our customers because they cannot afford the increases. We also cannot source these products domestically."\n\nTorkos said the uncertainty of future tariff costs has also led to the cancellation of key projects.\n\n"The recent removal from several bid processes due to the tariffs causing rising material prices further underscores the impact of these tariffs on our operations," Torkos said.\n\nCalculating tariff costs amid trade talk swings\n\nTo address the swings in tariffs, and in an effort to offer more certainty on possible freight costs, logistics firms are launching tariff analysis tools. C.H. Robinson and Flexport are among companies to roll out technology that allows businesses and consumers to model tariff impact on price.\n\nWine for Europe is one example that can impact both the business and consumer. The EU was threatened by President Trump in a social media post of a 50% tariff, only to have that threat walked back by the president, delaying that increase from June 1 to July 9.\n\nAccording to the Flexport Tariff Simulator, if a container with bottles of Chianti from Italy was processed by U.S. Customs on June 2, the wine would be under a 10.24% tariff rate. The duties for one 20-foot container filled with 0.75L bottles of Chianti would be $27,024. If the tariff were increased by another 50%, the tariff bill would soar from $27,024 to $132,624. The tariff rate was based on a wholesale value of $264,000 ($20 a bottle w/13,200 bottles in a container.)\n\nThen, there is the stacking of multiple tariff layers already implemented during the trade war. These duties have pushed up costs to import retail goods much higher than the 30% associated with the tentative agreement.\n\nUsing an example of a common summer retail purchase, Flexport data shows a 20-foot container storing 60 fully assembled aluminum chaise lounge chairs with a wholesale value of $60,000, departing from China on June 2 and arriving on July 15 would face a 70% tariff \u2014 that includes Section 301 tariffs at 25% under the 1974 Trade Act\'s unfair practices policy; Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum at 25%; and the national emergency powers fentanyl tariffs at 20%. The total amount in tariffs for that single container would be $42,000.\n\nA women\'s top imported from India faced a tariff rate on June 2 of 42%. After the reciprocal tariff deadline is lifted, the same top will be taxed at 58%.\n\nBut additional variables remain in play.\n\n"It\'s not that simple to calculate," said Ryan Petersen, Flexport CEO. "There\'s still a lot of uncertainty about what\'s going to happen. For example, it may not be on the tip of everyone\'s tongue right now, but July 8 is the end of the reciprocal tariffs pause. That could end, and tariffs may not be 10% everywhere. Commerce Secretary [Howard] Lutnick has made comments he is committed to making the tariffs higher."\n\nMike Short, president of global forwarding at C.H. Robinson, said for companies to save on tariff costs, they need to have the ability to search their SKUs and identify the product\'s point of origin so they can tabulate tariff costs.\n\n"Based on that information, they could then quickly compare their total duty spending versus various alternative sources," said Short. "Knowing the spending scenarios can provide businesses with clarity on where to focus their efforts to achieve savings and diversification, down to the individual product level," he added.',

    text: 'Tyrone Siu | Reuters\n\nThe trade truce reached between the U.S. and China arrived just as President Donald Trump\'s tariffs took a big bite out of North American & Asian manufacturing, with a steep retreat in April purchasing activity after the rush to hoard supply, according to the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index.\n\n"The pause on tariffs is a major relief for manufacturers in both the U.S. and China," said John Piatek, vice president of consulting for GEP. "Our Supply Chain Volatility Index shows manufacturing demand in China is dropping steeply, and U.S. manufacturers are aggressively stockpiling key inputs to buffer against tariffs."\n\nBut according to Piatek, the trade deal won\'t quickly quiet U.S. manufacturers\' anxiety about how to reduce risks related to China for the long-term. "As they maneuver to de-risk and limit exposure to China, the rapidly changing landscape and uncertainty is clouding manufacturers\' outlook and dampening their capital investment and supply chain," he said.\n\nThe GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index tracks demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses.\n\n"The first blows of the tariff war have landed on global manufacturers," Piatek said. The supply chain volatility data should serve as a warning about what would come next if the temporary pause in tariffs by the U.S. and China aren\'t extended permanently after the 90-day pause and the trade war re-escalates.\n\nThe data showed a "hockey stick"-like upturn in April, according to Piatek, with North American companies aggressively stockpiling inventory at what he described as a "concerning rate." At the same time, "the first signs of manufacturers anticipating slower demand and supply shortages have emerged," he said.\n\nPurchasing activity by manufacturers in Asia was at its weakest since December 2023.\n\nOne bright spot to offset pull back in manufacturing is Europe, where an industrial recession is coming to an end. The U.K., the first nation to sign a preliminary trade deal with the U.S., recorded significant manufacturing weakness, with supplier activity down to a rate near a record low based on the past two decades of data. But supply chain capacity in Germany and France, which was underutilized over the past year, is reflecting growth. Piatek cautioned that this could reverse if global trade conditions worsen.\n\nThe GEP data also shows an increase in spare capacity across Asian supply chains in April, led by China, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nStephen Edwards, CEO of the Port of Virginia, told CNBC in an interview published this week that if the supply chain future is less China and more Southeast Asia, South Asia and Europe, the U.S. port is positioned for that growth.\n\n"Our fastest growth over the last four years has been the Indian subcontinent, then Vietnam, then Europe," said Edwards.\n\nTrade from China has been flat for the last four years at Port of Virginia.\n\n"It is our second-largest trading bloc after the European Union. So it\'s still a big block," he said. "But if that is going to migrate over time, whatever the new trade environment is, there\'s an opportunity. We have not yet seen the trade agreements, but we believe that it\'s going to be less China and more from Southeast Asia and Europe. I think we\'re in a pretty good spot," Edwards said.',

    text: 'The freight business is impacted by the ongoing trade pressures, with port labor and trucking and rail industries that depend on container volumes also taking a hit.\n\n"Currently, we are experiencing a significant decline since the end of Q1," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain at ITS Logistics. "This decline is primarily attributed to the high tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. Some volume was buoyed by front-loading and alternative sourcing from Southeast Asia, India, and Europe. However, we expect this downward trend to continue throughout May and into early June, while shippers restart import operations from China."\n\nBrashier said because some orders have been un-paused, there will be a short-lived container increase, but it will not be a sustained Covid container "surge."\n\nAfter ocean carriers cut down on vessel sailings due to the trade war, they will need to ramp up vessel capacity quickly to accommodate the sudden increase in cargo, and for shippers to get their cargo in by the peak season cargo deadline of Aug. 14, according to Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence. "This means cargo needs to be shipped no later than by mid-July," he said.\n\nOn the Transpacific trade to the North America West Coast, he said there has not yet been what he would call "a meaningful injection of new capacity," while on the East Coast, he added that there has already been some attempt to increase capacity relative to just a week ago.\n\nMore than half of the CNBC survey respondents answering a question about blanked sailings say they remain concerned about available ocean freight space.\n\nFront-loading of orders will help retail, for now\n\nTo some extent, the rush of orders earlier this year, the "front-loading" ahead of tariffs, has created some room for retail inventory to be effectively managed.\n\nRetailers tell CNBC they were forced to abandon some freight at the ports because it was too expensive to pay the expected tariffs on China. Logistics respondents said that abandoned freight was moved to the secondary market, auction houses, and special bonded warehouses called "General Order," where, after six months, if the goods are not cleared within that timeframe, they may be sold at auction, donated, or retained by the government. U.S. Customs oversees these warehouses.\n\nBrett Rose, CEO of United National Consumer Suppliers, which supplies products to stores such as Macy\'s, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Ross Stores and third-party Amazon sellers, said he is seeing activity increase in the secondary market.\n\n"While retail will undoubtedly feel the ripple effects of new tariffs over time, in the near term, we\'re seeing the market absorb the shock differently," said Rose. "There\'s currently a significant buffer in the form of excess inventory in the secondary market," he added.\n\nUNCS says in the last quarter alone, it tracked nearly $500 million worth of surplus goods already onshore and circulating domestically.\n\n"This oversupply is helping to insulate immediate pricing pressures, but that cushion won\'t last forever," Rose said.\n\nJon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, tells CNBC there is still a great deal of uncertainty for businesses on how to proceed in the coming months, with retailers planning to purchase and rush shipments for the holiday season to avoid tariff increases in mid-August, but with the headwind of increased freight costs as ocean carrier capacity constraints run up against restarted orders.\n\n"The lack of forward clarity is adding to the confusion, and to the costs incurred from the importer down to the consumer," said Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA.\n\nNoah Hoffman, vice president for retail logistics at C.H. Robinson, says the timing for Christmas imports is a question mark, with three major factors at play. "Consumer demand is muted, ocean shipping rates are elevated, and tariffs are as volatile as ever," said Hoffman. "What\'s the bigger gamble during this 90-day window? Pulling holiday inventory forward while ocean rates are up and demand signals are uncertain, or waiting too long and risking that tariffs go up again? That\'s the conversation a number of retailers and retail suppliers are having with us right now," he said.\n\nConsumer spending optimism is low\n\nIn answer to a question on holiday order priorities, 59% of respondents to the CNBC survey said they are focused on lower-priced goods, while 29% said promotional items. When asked what types of products are getting hit the hardest, 42% of respondents answering this question said discretionary products, followed by luxury (26%), furniture (19%) and travel (13%).\n\nClose to one-third among more than 50 companies taking the CNBC Survey who answered a question about level of pullbacks in orders for the holidays put the range at between 20%-29%.\n\nIn separate interviews with brands and retailers, CNBC was told inventories range from one to three months and the risk of empty shelves for some products can be measured in a similar time frame.\n\nRetailers are being careful about how they discuss price increases after President Donald Trump blasted both Amazon and Walmart in recent weeks over their plans and commentary on tariffs and consumer inflation. On Tuesday, Home Depot said it would "generally maintain" prices on products even with tariffs, a few days after Trump told Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" in a social media post, and said he would be watching what the company did. On Wednesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said there has been no slowdown in spending to date due to tariffs. But Target cuts its full-year sales outlook on Wednesday, citing tariffs among several other factors.\n\nOptimism on consumer spending in the CNBC survey was low, with 75% of over 80 respondents asked if they foresee a consumer pullback saying yes, and 53% of an almost equal number of total respondents saying that pullback has already started.\n\nWithin the retail supply chain, pricing pressure is already percolating, according to Adam Davis, managing director of Wells Fargo Retail Finance.\n\n"We have seen upward pressure on pricing recently, which might impact the ultimate retail price and degree of discounts offered as retailers navigate the evolving tariff environment in concert with current and future inventory levels," said Davis.\n\nHis concerns include retailers that have recently reduced inventory purchases, as well as price increases, but he added that the higher prices will be selectively applied.\n\n"We anticipate pricing adjustments to be methodical and specific to certain items versus a broad-brush approach," Davis said, adding that making changes over time can help "to soften the impact to customers" from increasing prices on specific items versus "everything at once."\n\nFor small businesses, there is less room to absorb cost increases.\n\n"It is impossible for small brands to eat the costs of these tariffs," said Bruce Kaminstein, a member of NY Angels and founder and former CEO of cleaning products company Casabella.\n\nIn interviews, retailers told CNBC tariffs become unsustainable for the company based on their current margins at 30% to 40%.\n\nRecession risks still high amid trade war uncertainty\n\nMore than half of 80 respondents to the CNBC survey who answered a question on recession risk said they are still betting on an economic downturn, though the timing of that was split between those who say the recession has already begun (23%), and almost equal groupings of those who see it coming in the quarters ahead, from Q3 and Q4 of this year, to 2026.\n\nMark Baxa, CEO of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, said that mixed view on recession timing makes sense given what the supply chain is experiencing.\n\n"We are in the midst of shifting sourcing and purchasing patterns, driven by a mix of current and anticipated consumer purchasing shifts, consumer pullback, and recession fears," said Baxa. "Results are mixed in terms of timing and actions businesses are taking," he said, but he added that the overall sentiment "is that supply chains anticipate fiscal headwinds as the year unfolds."\n\nExpectations for a freight recession, specifically, are similarly spread out over time, according to the survey results.\n\n"We\'ll have a clearer picture by July, when two factors converge, how many trade deals the U.S. has made with other countries before higher reciprocal tariffs are slated to kick in again, and how much freight demand there is after produce season and beverage season peak," said Ronnie Davis, vice president for North American surface transportation at C.H. Robinson. "Sometime this summer, we\'ll know whether this 90-day lowering of tariffs between the United States and China holds and how much holiday inventory might have been pulled forward in the meantime."\n\nTrump has said the global trade war is about bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., but the survey shows the continued pattern of choosing a "China-plus-one" strategy, and setting up manufacturing in another country, a shift that began during Trump\'s first trade war with China in 2017.\n\nRespondents to the survey who answered a question on freight and supply chain shifts say Vietnam continues to be the top outsourcing destination (66%), followed by India (55%), Malaysia (31%) and Cambodia (21%), with the remaining identifying other countries like Sri Lanka, Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and Pakistan.',

This boosts immediate demand and solves logistical challenges for smaller or remote operators.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Airbus and LanzaJet to Collaborate on Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production\n\nJulien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, explained:\n\n\u201cSupporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.\u201d\n\nThe first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed closely by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup\u2014highlighting broad industry support.\n\nThe pilot aims to evaluate the scalability, reliability, and market appetite for third-party facilitation of SAF, shaping the future of sustainable aviation fuel globally.",

    text: 'The intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran is forcing European airlines into increasingly narrow and congested flight corridors, further complicating global aviation routes already constrained by Russian airspace closures since the onset of the Ukraine war.\n\nMajor carriers including Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, and Wizz Air have joined over 150 airlines worldwide in either cancelling or rerouting flights following sudden closures of airspace over Israel, Iraq, and Jordan, according to the Financial Times. The latest restrictions arrive at a particularly vulnerable moment for the aviation sector, which is still absorbing the shock of a fatal Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash involving Air India that claimed over 270 lives last week.\n\n"The Air India [crash] happened and literally a day later the war started," said Steve Trent, an airline analyst with Citigroup. "Things just keep piling up."\n\nEurope\u2019s Flight Corridors Shrink Further\n\nEuropean airlines, already forced to navigate around Russian territory to reach East Asia, now face even tighter restrictions as new no-fly zones emerge across the Middle East. The combination has left carriers with minimal safe airspace for long-haul flights, reported The Financial Express.\n\n"We already fly around Russia, so it does make it very challenging," the report said citing a person familiar with the operations of a major European airline. The source described the available international flight routes as "a really tiny corridor."\n\nLufthansa reported that its flights from Frankfurt and Munich to East Asian destinations are now being rerouted, resulting in delays that can extend up to an hour. Meanwhile, Air France-KLM and others have chosen to avoid northern Saudi Arabian airspace altogether due to mounting security risks, further limiting their routing options.\n\nAlso Read : Tokyo Struggles For Trade Deal As Japan\u2019s Exports Tumble On Trump Tariffs\n\nFuel Costs Surge as Detours Lengthen Flights\n\nThe need to divert long-haul flights not only extends travel times but also drives up fuel consumption at a time when energy prices are already rising. Brent crude has surged about 8 per cent since last Thursday, reaching $70.80 per barrel. With jet fuel prices climbing, airlines are seeing their profit margins squeezed further, especially as longer routes may require additional refuelling stops or crew changes.\n\nFlight tracking data from Flightradar24 indicates that airspace over Iran, Iraq, and Syria has largely been vacated. Flights are now funnelling through southern Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The data also reveals that over 3,000 flights have been cancelled daily in the region since the conflict escalated.\n\nMiddle East Airlines Hit Hard as Routes Disappear\n\nCarriers based in the Gulf, such as Emirates and Qatar Airways, have been particularly affected. These airlines, which typically operate over 100 flights daily through Iranian and Iraqi skies, now face significant operational disruptions. These Middle Eastern routes have long been critical for both passenger and freight movement between East and West.\n\nAs instability persists, industry experts predict the situation could worsen. Some airlines are already considering adjustments to flight planning, including potential fuel stops and crew rotations, in anticipation of further airspace closures.\n\nThe current crisis adds to years of growing geopolitical turmoil that have increasingly reshaped international aviation. Once-stable long-haul flight paths have become patchworks of detours, with growing operational costs and complexity.\n\n\u201cA headache is colossal," observed air travel analyst John Strickland. "Anything that requires a rerouting is expensive\u2014and this is a busy part of the country."\n\nWith ongoing tensions in both the Middle East and Eastern Europe, global airlines appear destined to navigate persistent logistical hurdles and financial pressures for the foreseeable future.',

    text: "New Delhi [India], June 22 (ANI): In a significant move to enhance India's aviation safety framework, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has launched a comprehensive special audit initiative under General Safety Circular 01 of 2025, announcing the rollout of a Comprehensive Special Audit initiative aimed at providing a 360-degree assessment of the nation's aviation ecosystem.\n\nThe initiative reflects a strategic shift from the conventional silo-based oversight system to an integrated, risk-informed, performance-driven model of regulatory auditing & DGCA's commitment to fostering a safe, efficient, and sustainable aviation environment. By integrating global best practices--including those from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP), and India's National Aviation Safety Plan--the audits will assess compliance, operational performance, and system resilience across all facets of the aviation industry.\n\nThis audit will proactively identify systemic vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience across India's aviation sector.\n\nUnlike routine checks, the special audits will apply to a broad spectrum of stakeholders, ranging from scheduled and private air operators to maintenance firms, training institutions, air navigation providers, and ground handlers. Even supporting elements such as emergency systems and technology vendors fall within its scope, underlining DGCA's ambition for a truly end-to-end evaluation.\n\nThe document reads, 'The Special Audit applies to all primary aviation entities, including scheduled, non-scheduled, and private air operators, Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) organisations, Approved Training Organisations (ATOs), Flying Training Organisations (FTOs), Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP), Aerodrome Operators, and Ground Handling Agencies (GHAs).\n\nAdditionally, it encompasses supporting elements such as technology providers, emergency response systems, supply chain networks, and regulatory coordination bodies. This broad scope ensures a holistic evaluation of the interconnected components that define the aviation ecosystem.\n\nAudits will be carried out by multidisciplinary teams led by senior DGCA officials and supported by subject-matter experts from various aviation domains. The assessment will include document reviews, on-site inspections, staff interviews, and analysis of safety data trends.\n\nFindings will be classified by severity, with deadlines for corrective action ranging from 7 to 90 days. Entities will be required to submit a corrective action plan within 15 days of the audit's conclusion, and failure to comply could lead to escalating enforcement, from warnings and fines to suspension of licenses.\n\nThe audit process is divided into three phases. The Pre-Audit Phase (5-7 days) involves intelligence gathering, stakeholder consultation, risk profiling, and audit plan development. The On-Site Audit Phase (3-5 days) includes an opening meeting to clarify objectives, followed by document reviews, inspections, interviews, process observations, and daily debriefs to discuss preliminary findings. The Post-Audit Phase (10-15 days) encompasses finding validation, risk assessment, final report preparation, and publication.\n\nThis structured process ensures transparency and stakeholder engagement throughout, as mentioned in the document.\n\nThe audits may be triggered by critical incidents, regulatory violations, or international findings, but they will also be scheduled proactively, including annual ecosystem-wide reviews. The DGCA has committed to transparency, confidentiality, and due process throughout the audit lifecycle, including provisions for appeal.\n\nWith this new framework now in immediate effect, DGCA aims not only to meet international standards but to set them. The agency sees this initiative as central to building a world-class aviation infrastructure that is resilient, accountable, and future-ready.",

The decision regarding the location for decoding the flight recorders will be taken by the AAIB after due assessment of all technical, safety, and security considerations.\u201d\n\nIt further urged restraint in coverage of the ongoing probe, emphasising the seriousness of the matter. \u201cThe Ministry of Civil Aviation urges all stakeholders to refrain from speculation on such sensitive matters and to allow the investigative process to proceed with the seriousness and professionalism it warrants,\u201d it said.\n\nThis comes as reports claimed that one or both of the flight recorders may be sent abroad for detailed analysis.\n\nMoCA Launches Safety and Performance Review\n\nIn the aftermath of the Air India AI171 tragedy near Ahmedabad, the Civil Aviation Ministry has launched a wide-ranging review of safety, airline performance, and passenger services. Union Minister of Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu chaired several meetings in New Delhi to assess operational readiness, including a high-level consultation with the Chairman and Managing Director of Air India.\n\nThe Minister underscored the importance of maintaining operational continuity, strengthening transparent communication, and prioritising passenger safety and convenience. Given the backdrop of reduced aircraft availability due to ongoing safety checks and geopolitical disruptions such as airspace closures in parts of Europe and the Middle East, Air India has been advised to temporarily scale down operations. The airline is expected to restructure flights, inform passengers through the media, and ensure either rebooking or full refunds for affected travellers.\n\nMoCA also held consultations with senior management teams of SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Akasa Air on 18 and 19 June to evaluate fleet performance, safety oversight, and passenger experience. The Minister announced that periodic operational reviews with all airlines will be institutionalised to ensure coordinated performance monitoring.\n\nRam Mohan Naidu conducted a video conference with all Airport Directors across India, issuing directives aimed at strengthening ground-level readiness in light of disruptions triggered by the crash, weather shifts, and restricted airspace usage. Airports have been instructed to ensure:\n\nCoordination with airlines for swift passenger assistance.\n\nAvailability of food, water, and seating during delays.\n\nAdequate staffing to proactively address passenger grievances.\n\nLogistical support to airlines, including gate reassignments.\n\nReinforced wildlife and stray animal deterrence measures on airport premises.\n\nAir India Crash Investigation Underway With Global Assistance\n\nA formal investigation into the tragic crash is being conducted by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The AAIB team began their probe on 12 June 2025, and are being supported by experts from the US-based National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), in line with international protocols laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Ministry confirmed that the AAIB's investigation is progressing steadily, with full support from local authorities and relevant agencies.\n\nTwo sets of black boxes\u2014each comprising a Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR)\u2014have been recovered from the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner involved in the crash. The first set was recovered on 13 June, and the second on 16 June. The MoCA clarified that this aircraft model is equipped with dual black box systems, which are essential for reconstructing the chain of events that led to the accident.\n\nThe crash, which took place near Ahmedabad, claimed the lives of 241 passengers and crew members, in addition to several casualties on the ground.\n\nIndia\u2019s Own Decoding Lab Ready, But Overseas Option Open\n\nAddressing the possibility of analysis abroad, MoCA said the AAIB will take a final decision based on the technical state of the recorders. India\u2019s newly established black box decoding facility at the Udaan Bhawan in Delhi, inaugurated in April 2025 with the assistance of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, is fully equipped for such investigations.\n\nHowever, according to The Mint, officials said that if the recovered units are found to be severely damaged or if the domestic lab lacks certain specialised capabilities, the recorders may be sent to advanced facilities overseas. Given that the aircraft was manufactured by Boeing, the United States is being considered a likely option for further analysis if needed.",

This includes a wide range of appliances such as refrigerator-freezers, dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, freezers, cooking stoves, ranges, ovens, food waste disposals, and welded wire racks.\n\nThe tariffs will be calculated based on the value of the steel content in each imported item, meaning higher steel content will result in higher duties.\n\nThis decision follows a week after President Trump increased tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50 per cent, up from the initial 25 per cent announced in March.\n\nAlso read : Israel-Iran War Makes D-Street Bleed, Sensex Over 550 Points Down, Nifty Nears 24,700.

Although both companies have U.S. manufacturing facilities (Samsung in Newberry, South Carolina, and LG in Clarksville, Tennessee, both established during Trump's first term in response to his tariff policies), a significant portion of their appliances sold in the U.S. are manufactured overseas, including in South Korea and Mexico. Much of the steel used is also sourced internationally.\n\nBoth Samsung and LG are considering shifting some production in Mexico from their U.S. plants in light of these escalated tariffs. Analysts warn that these tariffs could increase production costs, which companies may be forced to pass on to consumers through higher prices.\n\nWith Samsung and LG collectively holding approximately 40 percent of the U.S. home appliance market, according to Traqline, price increases could undermine their competitiveness and reduce sales in the crucial US market.",

    text: "Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) is cautious about tariff reductions on farm products under the proposed India-US trade deal and emphasised that the potential impact of opening India's markets to subsidised American farm products needs careful consideration and thorough debate.\n\nGTRI argued, once tariffs are cut in such agreements, it becomes nearly impossible to raise them again, even if prices crash, global trade is disrupted, or local farmers face sudden losses. It said this would expose India, especially as rich countries like the US and EU subsidise their agriculture heavily.\n\nNiti Aayog's May 2025 working paper, \"Promoting India-US Agricultural Trade Under The New US Trade Regime,\" recommends that India open its market to a wide range of US farm products, including rice, pepper, soybean oil, shrimp, tea, coffee, dairy, poultry, apples, almonds, pistachios, corn, and genetically modified (GM) soy products, under the proposed India-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThe government advisory body argues for eliminating tariffs on rice and pepper because India exports these items in large volumes. But GTRI contends that subsidised grain exports from developed nations like the US and EU have been a major driver of global grain price volatility, which can impact India's farmers and exports.\n\nNiti Aayog's recommendations also address the supply gaps for reciprocal access, but GTRI says they ignore the structural risks to India's 700 million farmers.\n\nCiting past experiences, such as binding zero tariffs for rice and wheat under GATT in the 1960s/70s, GTRI says it left India vulnerable and forced costly renegotiations. India should go for a flexible tariff regime.\n\n\"Keeping tariff flexibility is not outdated protectionism--it's a smart, essential policy tool to protect food security, support rural incomes, and respond to market shocks. Once this flexibility is given up in a trade agreement, getting it back is extremely difficult,\" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI.\n\nNiti Aayog also backs importing GM products like DDGS and soybean seeds under strict controls. However, GTRI argues that India's fragmented logistics and weak regulatory enforcement make such containment unfeasible. \"Once GM material enters the domestic chain, it risks contaminating local agriculture, creating trade disputes, and undermining public trust,\" added Srivastava\n\nThe government planning body also recommends importing dairy and poultry products from the US, subject to the US meeting sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures rather than tariffs.\n\nOn dairy products, the US has challenged India's SPS requirement that imported milk must come from animals not fed meat, blood, or internal organs. The US sees this as an unjustified trade barrier, but India considers it essential for public health and cultural values.\n\nGTRI says replacing tariffs with weaker and challenge-prone SPS standards can erode both safety and ethical standards. It adds that NITI Aayog's recommendations are risky and require broader public consultation before being considered.",

    text: "In a development that caught many off guard, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney revealed on Monday that he and US President Donald Trump have agreed to attempt finalising a new bilateral economic and security agreement within 30 days.\n\nThis announcement came shortly after Canadian officials had cautioned that significant differences still remained between both countries before any deal could be reached, reported Reuters.\n\nCarney, who secured victory in the April elections with a pledge to challenge Trump's tariffs, is advocating for what he describes as a revamped partnership on both economic and security fronts with Washington. The two leaders held talks on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Alberta, where Trump once again emphasised his firm stance on tariffs.\n\nDiscussions Intensify Amid Tariff Disputes\n\n\"Prime Minister Carney and President Trump ... shared updates on key issues raised in negotiations on a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the US,\" Carney's office stated. The statement further confirmed that both leaders have committed to working towards securing an agreement within the next month.\n\nWhen asked to clarify if the commitment implied Canada had softened its opposition to some US tariffs, Carney's office did not immediately respond, the news agency reported.\n\nTrump, however, made it clear that his insistence on tariffs remains unchanged. \"I have a tariff concept. Mark has a different concept ... we're going to see if we can get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said, adding, \"I'm a tariff person.\"\n\nAlso Read : Oil Prices Surge As Trump Urges Tehran Evacuation Amid Escalating Conflict\n\nCanada Pushes Back as Tensions Simmer\n\nAs the leading exporter of steel and aluminium to the US, Canada has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs on these key industries, as well as on auto exports. Carney acknowledged last week that intense negotiations were ongoing and warned that Canada was preparing retaliatory measures should discussions fail to yield results.\n\nDespite the latest optimistic turn, some Canadian officials privately expressed skepticism over the timeline, noting that the US appeared unhurried in its approach. \"We are in the middle of a discussion - we are not at the end of the discussion. Our position is that we should have no tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States,\" stated Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to Washington. She stressed that talks would persist until an agreement is reached that serves Canada's best interests.",

China linked its control over rare earth metals, a critical input for electronics, to America's move to block Chinese access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nIf Trump wants to strike a deal with China, he may need to distance himself from the national security lobby that supports tougher trade restrictions.\n\nAlso read : Israel-Iran War Makes D-Street Bleed, Sensex Over 550 Points Down, Nifty Nears 24,700.

In April, gold imports in China rose 73 per cent month-on-month to 127.5 tonnes, the highest in 11 months.\n\nThe figure represents nearly half of the average global monthly gold output outside China. According to the World Gold Council, holdings in China's gold ETFs have grown by 82.1 tonnes so far this year, surpassing last year's total of 53.3 tonnes, even though 6.1 tonnes were withdrawn since May.\n\nIn conclusion, the report by Jefferies signals a possible softening in Trump's trade stance, with a proposed shift toward uniform tariffs suggesting an intent to simplify policy while still maintaining pressure on China.\n\nAt the same time, China is using smart countermeasures, linking rare earth exports to U.S. restrictions and boosting gold reserves, to strengthen its economic resilience. The evolving dynamic underscores a potential recalibration in U.S.-China trade relations ahead of upcoming policy decisions.",

    text: "After a temporary halt linked to escalating trade tensions, Boeing appears poised to resume aircraft deliveries to China.

Deliveries to Chinese customers ceased abruptly in April as a result of retaliatory tariffs sparked by deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing. A spokesperson for Boeing declined to offer further details, while representatives from Xiamen Airlines and the Chinese government were not available for comment, the news organisation reported.\n\nTrade Talks Signal a Shift\n\nTensions began to ease after the US and China reached a tentative agreement on May 12 to suspend the majority of tariffs for a 90-day period. President Donald Trump announced that negotiators from both countries would reconvene on June 9 in London to discuss a more permanent trade solution. The shift in policy has sparked renewed optimism about restoring commercial ties in the aerospace sector.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg confirmed on May 29 that aircraft deliveries to Chinese carriers were expected to resume in June. The company previously stated that due to tariffs, Chinese customers would not be accepting new aircraft, and it was considering reselling some of the planes originally destined for China.\n\nAlso read : Walmart Expands Drone Deliveries With Google-Owned Wing In 5 New Locations; Details Inside\n\nImpact on Inventory and Production\n\nIn April, Boeing moved at least three 737 MAX aircraft back to the US from its Zhoushan completion facility near Shanghai, where jets undergo final preparations before delivery. Notably, the same aircraft that recently took off for Hawaii was the first one returned from China. Despite interest from other airlines, Boeing has held onto these planes and has not redirected them to alternative buyers.\n\nChina is a crucial market for Boeing, representing approximately 10 per cent of its commercial aircraft backlog. The company anticipated that 50 aircraft would be delivered to Chinese carriers over the rest of the year, with 41 of those either completed or under production as of April.\n\nWhile Beijing has not publicly commented on the suspension of Boeing deliveries, it did acknowledge that the US-imposed tariffs had severely impacted both Chinese airlines and the aircraft manufacturer.",

This automotive provision, alongside the removal of tariffs on aerospace products including parts and aircraft, is scheduled to take effect seven days after official publication in the Federal Register.\n\nThe UK Trade Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds emphasised the deal\u2019s benefits, highlighting the aerospace and auto industries as key winners. \u201cBringing trade deals into force can take several months, yet we are delivering on the first set of agreements in a matter of weeks. And we won\u2019t stop there," Reynolds stated. He also confirmed that both sides had agreed to reciprocal access allowing up to 13,000 metric tons of beef exports, though US products will still need to comply with stringent British food safety standards.\n\nMore Discussions To Follow, Focus On Pharma Sector\n\nWhile some significant advances have been made, several aspects of the broader trade relationship remain under negotiation. Both nations are actively working towards achieving preferential terms for the UK pharmaceutical sector and ensuring protection against potential new tariffs linked to ongoing Section 232 investigations by the US Commerce Department.\n\nIn response to a question about whether the UK is shielded from future US tariff threats, Trump responded in typical fashion: \u201cThe UK is very well protected. You know why? Because I like them. That\'s their ultimate protection.\u201d\n\nDespite this partial breakthrough, many observers note that the path to a comprehensive and fully resolved trade deal remains complex, with multiple sectors still awaiting clarity.',

    text: "In a dramatic shift reflecting broader geopolitical and trade dynamics, Apple has significantly reoriented its export strategy from India, with nearly all iPhones assembled by Foxconn being shipped to the United States between March and May this year.\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, customs data showed that 97 per cent of the iPhones exported from Foxconn\u2019s Indian facilities during this three-month period were destined for the US \u2014 a considerable rise from the 2024 average of just over 50 per cent.\n\nPreviously, iPhones manufactured in India were distributed to several markets, including the Netherlands, Britain, and the Czech Republic. However, this latest data highlights a clear pivot by Apple to avoid the impact of steep tariffs imposed by Washington on goods from China.\n\nBetween March and May, Foxconn exported iPhones worth $3.2 billion, with US-bound shipments peaking at $1.3 billion in March and reaching nearly $1 billion in May 2025 \u2014 the second-highest on record.\n\nTariff Tensions Drive Strategic Shifts\n\nThe surge in shipments coincides with renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump, who recently declared plans to impose 55 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, pending approval from both countries\u2019 leaders. Apple, which still relies on China for the majority of its global iPhone production, has been seeking alternative routes to supply its largest market \u2014 the US \u2014 without incurring heavy duties.\n\nIn a bid to streamline this supply chain, the tech giant has even used chartered flights to ship iPhone 13, 14, 16, and 16e models worth approximately $2 billion from India to the US in March. Additionally, Apple has been lobbying for faster customs clearance at Chennai airport \u2014 a crucial export point \u2014 aiming to reduce processing times from 30 hours to just six, the report noted.\n\nAlso read : Gold Prices Cross Rs 1 Lakh, Check Out Rates In Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, More Cities\n\nIndia\u2019s Role Grows Despite Cost Hurdles\n\nWith India now central to Apple\u2019s diversification strategy, analysts expect the country to account for a growing share of global iPhone production. \u201cWe expect made-in-India iPhones to account for 25 per cent to 30 per cent of global iPhone shipments in 2025, as compared to 18 per cent in 2024,\u201d said Prachir Singh, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\n\nFoxconn has already shipped $4.4 billion worth of iPhones to the US from India in the first five months of 2025, surpassing its total of $3.7 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, Tata Electronics, a relatively newer player in Apple\u2019s supply chain, has also been redirecting the majority of its output to the US, with customs data showing 86 per cent of its shipments went there during March and April. This marked a sharp increase from 2024, when only 52 per cent of its exports were US-bound.\n\nDespite this momentum, India\u2019s ambition to become a global manufacturing hub still faces challenges. The cost of producing smartphones locally remains high due to elevated duties on imported components. Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to champion India as a competitive manufacturing base in the global tech ecosystem.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been vocal about his disapproval of Apple\u2019s offshore production plans. In a pointed remark directed at Apple CEO Tim Cook, he said, \u201cWe are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here.\u201d",

With 43 billion pounds in existing trade and 25.5 billion pounds in incremental upside, it opens doors to real gains for manufacturers and services providers alike.\u201d\n\nKang, who is also the Deputy High Commissioner for Western India, revealed the next steps: legal scrubbing, Prime Ministerial signing, parliamentary ratification (expected in 9\u201312 months), and staggered implementation. He affirmed that services liberalisation, auto tariffs (with quotas), and "a future-ready tech-security corridor\u201d were built into the agreement, with potential expansion into sectors like pharma, semiconductors, and green tech.\n\nDetailing the contours of the FTA, he said that under the India-UK FTA, 99 per cent of Indian goods to the UK and 90 per cent of UK goods to India will become tariff-free.\n\nThe UK\u2019s peak tariff on whisky will reduce from 150 per cent to 40 per cent over 10 years. The CBAM (carbon border adjustment mechanism) is not part of the India\u2013UK FTA, reassuring Indian industry that carbon taxes will not affect bilateral trade terms under this agreement, he explained.\n\nThere will also be a significant liberalisation in services under the FTA, with 36 sectors under Contractual Service Suppliers and 16 under Independent Professionals, including IT, R&D, chefs, yoga instructors, and musicians.\n\nAlongside the FTA, the UK and India have agreed to negotiate a reciprocal DCC, which will mean employees temporarily working in the other country for up to three years will continue paying social security contributions only in their home country, Kang added.\n\nAccording to Amisha Vora, Chairperson & MD, PL Capital, 72 per cent of India\u2019s exports to the UK - including electronics, fuels, chemicals, textiles, and apparel - run a trade surplus, positioning sectors like auto components, engineering goods, and textiles for a meaningful upside.\n\nAlso read : Air India Crash Fallout: IndiGo, SpiceJet, And Singapore Airlines Shares Drop\n\nEmphasising the FTA\u2019s services dimension at a panel discussion, she highlighted India\u2019s $18 billion in services exports to the UK, the second-largest after the US, and underscored the increased mobility for Indian IT, creative, and professional talent as a soft power and services export amplifier.\n\nFrom a macro lens, she framed the deal as reflective of two decisive shifts: Britain\u2019s post-Brexit diversification away from China toward democratic demand, and India\u2019s effort to anchor deeper into rules-based, like-minded economies without ceding regulatory sovereignty.\n\nAnuj Agarwal, chief economist at Welspun Group, highlighted the opportunity in the textiles sector: "The sector is 2.3 per cent of India\u2019s GDP, 12\u201313 per cent of industrial output, and employs 45 million people. But our UK exports are only $1.5 billion\u2014far below Bangladesh and Vietnam. This FTA gives India a fair shot at reclaiming its share. The tariff timelines will determine the pace of investment response. However, if the reductions are staggered too long, industry excitement may mellow down."',

    text: 'Weeks before top BRICS leaders converge in Rio de Janeiro for summit talks, envoys of leading member nations of the grouping hinted that it could focus on greater use of national currencies for trade in the face of uncertainties over Trump administration\'s aggressive policy on tariff.\n\nRussian Ambassador Denis Alipov reaffirmed Moscow\'s strong support for trade in local currency among BRICS member nations and described the grouping as "a serious platform for discussing joint solutions to big challenges".\n\nThe summit is unlikely to make any significant progress on the proposed BRICS currency as it will need significant structural changes and reforms. In the last few months, President Donald Trump has cautioned BRICS member nations against rolling out a BRICS currency to replace the US dollar.\n\n"BRICS is not a counter-bloc. It is a centre of gravity for countries seeking mutual respect and non-interference," Alipov said at a conference titled "BRICS in Rio: Shaping an Inclusive and Sustainable World Order" on Friday evening that was co-organised by the Embassy of Brazil in India and Centre for Global India Insights (CGII), a leading think tank focused on global affairs.\n\nThe 17th BRICS ((Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) summit will be held in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7. Brazil is hosting the summit in its capacity as the chair of the influential bloc.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and several other leaders of the member nations of the grouping are expected to attend the summit.\n\nEnhancing the use of national currencies in settling intra-BRICS trade figured prominently in discussions, with all panellists backing the proposal, which is already being implemented by BRICS countries.\n\nHowever, the panellists found the idea of a BRICS common currency impractical.\n\nBesides Alipov, India\'s BRICS sherpa and Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Dammu Ravi, Brazil\'s Ambassador to India Kenneth Felix Haczynski da Nobrega, Indonesia Ambassador Ina Hagniningtyas Krisnamurthi and Egypt\'s envoy Kamel Zayed Kamel Galal attended the conference.\n\nAlso Read : Bank Holidays Next Week: Banks To Remain Closed For Up To 3 Days, Check State-Wise Calendar\n\nIn his remarks, Ravi clarified that discussions around a BRICS common currency are still at a very early stage.\n\n"Today, for now, we are only looking at trade settlement in national currencies. Harmonisation of fiscal and monetary policies is very, very difficult to achieve, he said.\n\nNobrega and Ravi both reiterated that a common currency would require far deeper policy harmonisation -- something the EU struggled with despite far more economic alignment.\n\n"It\'s a long way," said Nobrega. "But trading in local currencies? That\'s already working." In his remarks, Alipov emphasised that BRICS is not an anti-West alliance but a platform of sovereign equals.\n\n"BRICS is not a counter-bloc. It is a centre of gravity for countries seeking mutual respect and non-interference," he said. The grouping, he added, is evolving into a "more comprehensive and more representative" platform with its latest round of expansion.\n\nBRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, expanded in 2024 to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates, with Indonesia joining in 2025.\n\nAmong the new members, Ambassador Ina Krisnamurthi of Indonesia made a powerful case for systemic reform.\n\n"Our international order, the rules-based system, is crashing into the limits of its founding vision," she said.\n\n"Multilateral institutions have failed to address the adverse impacts of recent challenges," the ambassador said.\n\nIndonesia\'s inclusion in BRICS, she noted, aligns fully with its foundational non-aligned foreign policy.\n\nShe laid out Indonesia\'s core priorities: better representation, swifter decision-making and stronger accountability.\n\n"Right now, the Global South represents 85 per cent of the world\'s population and 39 per cent of global GDP," Krisnamurthi said, pointing to demographic and economic shifts.\n\n"Yet multilateral institutions do not reflect this reality." Citing the combined middle-class surge across China, India, and ASEAN, she noted: "In 2000, only 150 million enjoyed middle-class living standards. Today, that number is 1.5 billion -- double the total population of Western countries." For BRICS to succeed, she added, it must be "not just dialogue but delivery", especially in areas of climate finance, humanitarian relief and data equity.\n\nEgypt\'s envoy to India brought both clarity and conviction to the table. Despite Egypt\'s recent formal entry into BRICS, he stressed that "Egypt has always viewed itself as a natural member of BRICS since the group\'s inception." He outlined Cairo\'s vision for the upcoming Rio summit: "We are keen that the group should focus on areas of cooperation that enjoy consensus, rather than divisive issues." The ambassador advocated for actionable progress, especially in Africa and the Middle East, and cautioned against BRICS taking on confrontational postures.\n\nOn regional security, Ambassador Galal called attention to the war in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan and Iran, while emphasising the need to "reform and strengthen the multilateral system in a way that reflects the evolving dynamics and rising role of developing countries".\n\nHe concluded by quoting the Book of the Dead: "What I hate is ignorance, smallness of imagination, the eye that sees no further than its own idol. All things are possible. Who you are is limited by who you think you are." Replacing the usual focus on "conflict, crisis, and challenge", Galal proposed a more optimistic quartet: "collaboration, complementarity, consensus and cohesion." The panel closed with an engaging Q and A session, where speakers fielded questions on the future of BRICS institutionalisation, the viability of a common currency, and the bloc\'s SDG ambitions.',
